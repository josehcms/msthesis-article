# Introduction

Brazil observed a significant drop on its total fertility levels from 1960s on [@merrick_berquo1983] and since 2010-2015 exhibits below replacement fertility levels [@berquo_cavenaghi2014;@castanheira_kohler2015;@lima_etal2018;@rios-neto_etal2018]. One main characteristic of this country fertility transition was the heterogeneous process that it took within country regions and across socioeconomic strata, both  in terms of transition, starting, timing and pace [@potter_etal2010]. 

The pioneers of fertility reduction were social groups with higher socioeconomic status, especially those living in urban and industrialized areas of South and Southeast of the country; they started first practice birth control, even before the beginning of the generalized decline of fertility in the 1960s [@merrick_berquo1983;@guzman_rodriguez1993;@goncalves_etal2019]. To the contrary of other developed regions of the globe, this contraceptive behaviour rapidly spread fast towards the lower status socioeconomic groups from Northern and Northeastern parts of Brazil [@carvalho_wong1992;@perpetuo_wajnman1998;@berquo_cavenaghi2014]. For example, in these last regions, social groups with lower education and income began to control fertility by the 1980s, but at a much accelerated pace than other regions, where the fertility decline took place twenty years earlier [@potter_etal2002;@potter_etal2010].

Several factors explain the converging fertility regimes of social groups and thus the fertility transition in Brazil. Industrialization and urbanization, changes in labor market and productive structures, reduction of infant mortality rates, higher access to formal schooling followed by a higher rates of female participation in the labor market, changes in gender relations, expansion of consumer society and communication systems among other factors related to socioeconomic and technological development [@merrick_berquo1983; @paiva1987;@faria1989;@oliveira1989;@lam_etal1992;@alves1994;@martine1996;@potter_etal2002;@castanheira_kohler2017;@rios-neto_etal2018]. Notwithstand, the difference in paces and periods that each region experienced the fertility transition can be attributed to an uneven spread of these factors through the country, resulting in non-negligible demographic inequalities  [@wood_carvalho1988;@patarra_oliveira1988;@carvalho_brito2005;@wong_carvalho2006].  

Despite the importance of all these variables, we may argue that the expansion of population’s access to education was one of the main drivers of the fertility transition in Brazil [@merrick_berquo1983;@lam_etal1992;@carvalho_wong1992], especially in more recent periods. Education exerts multiple direct and indirect influences on demographic processes [@lutz2010]. For instances, family formation and reproductive behavior are affected by the levels of individual’s education, because it provides the basis for human capital formation, which affects in turn the people’s life course decisions, by favoring more women participation in the labor market and postponing their the entry into motherhood as consequence [@neels_etal2017]; education may also impulsing changes in the composition of conjugal markets and assortative mating profiles [@mare1991;@esteve_mcaa2007;@ribeiro_silva2009] and, at last, it helps to shape individual’s social and gender norms that foster new ideals of family size [@jejeebhoy1995;@mcdonald2000;@esping-andersen2009;@adsera2018]. 

In fertility studies, we may cite cohort fertility analysis as well as male fertility intention as tools that are being recently used for the assessment of fertility trends, specially in the context of postponement of childbearing [@sobotka2004;@bixby_etal2009;@neels_etal2017], rising female schooling [@esping-andersen2009;@neels_etal2017;@vanbavel_etal2018] and its consequent effects on changing gender norms, family commitment and reproductive behavior  [@mcdonald2000;@esping-andersen2009;@goldscheider_etal2015;@adsera2018]. Neither of these approaches have been broadly explored in Brazil, however.
 
Cohort analysis in Brazil are usually estimated using census or household data, as an alternative to the scarcity of reliable longitudinal surveys to track down life course demographic processes. These data sources provide information that permits the reconstruction of reproductive trends of cohorts in association with the urbanization, industrialization and schooling expansion of the country. By linking cohort analysis of women's reproductive data with the information on their spouse’s education, as a way to see the male influences on conjugal reproductive levels, during the course of the country's fertility transition.

Using different Brazilian censuses, we evaluate the cohort fertility of Brazilian educational pairings, taking into account the period of the country’s fertility transition. We estimate the cohort fertility of women within specific educational pairings in order to account for male’s educational influence on a couple's reproductive outcome. Our analysis also reports regional cohort fertility trends as a way to see how the country’s historical regional inequalities could affect fertility levels in each area.

The present work promotes important discussions and brings major contributions to Brazilian demographic analysis. First of all, there are few works that evaluate cohort fertility patterns trends throughout the process of educational expansion. Additionally, this work contemplates the partners that influenced the couple's reproductive levels [@thomson1997;@vanbavel2017;@nitsche_etal2018]. This analysis shed light on hidden processes of fertility transition that act within changes in gender norms and family structure, by assessing reproductive achievements and conjugal educational profiles of several generations, which in turn has experienced different life course processes and thus display diverse family formation.

# Background

## Fertility decline and school expansion in Brazil

The Fertility Transition process in Brazil is well documented by many studies. One remarkable characteristic of this process was the contrastend fertility levels among distinguished socioeconomic groups, as for example highly educated social groups already adopted a new reproductive behavior, well previous the beginning of the generalized decline of Brazilian fertility [@merrick_berquo1983], and a second noteworthy characteristic is that, compared to more developed regions, in a short period of time the fertility rates of the country from different social strata converged into replacement fertility [@berquo_cavenaghi2014], and more recently the TFR is below population replacement levels [@castanheira_kohler2015]. One particular element that contributed for this rapid transition and fertility convergence processes was the diffusion of contraceptive methods, in particular of female sterilization and the dissemination of contraceptive pill [@merrick_berquo1983;@martine1996;@perpetuo_wajnman1998;@perpetuo_wong2009]. Additionally, the uneven, or in some cases inexistent, access to family planning brought negative implications to the most vulnerable social groups [@carvalho_brito2005]. 

In the country, the low socioeconomic strata generally made use of more harmful and unreliable contraceptive methods (the only methods usually available for them). They mainly used sterilization and clandestine abortion as way to avoid furthers pregnancies, whereas wealthier families consumed other safer contraceptive methods, and they applied female sterilization only when their family size goals was achieved [@faria1997; @martine1996; @perpetuo_wajnman1998; @perpetuo_wong2009]. Nowadays, despite similar fertility levels, social groups also present different fertility timing, with lower educated women entering more frequently into motherhood at younger ages than their higher educated peers [@lima_etal2018], and fertility postponement being more common among this last group of women [@rios-neto_etal2018; @lima_etal2018].

In common, these studies show how education has become one and, if not, the most important key element to determine fertility outcomes in Brazil. According to @aries1978,  during the Seventeenth- and Eighteenth-Centuries, the educational systems were set up as important pillars of childhood formation and also seen as a social duty. Since then, schools have gained relevance in shaping individual’s transition into adulthood.

Schooling acts as a strong determinant of reproductive behavior of women through several mechanisms [@jejeebhoy1995]. In particular, formal education affects women's exposure to childbearing by influencing their labor market participation and conjugal decisions [@martin_juarez1995; @neels_etal2017]. Additionally, education also helps to provide the accomplishment of reproductive intentions, by giving access to information on modern contraceptive methods and through support to scientific knowledge [@cleland_wilson1987;@jejeebhoy1995].

Schooling acts as a strong determinant of reproductive behavior of women through several mechanisms [@jejeebhoy1995]. In particular, formal education affects women exposure to childbearing by influencing in labor market participation and conjugal decisions [@martin_juarez1995;@neels_etal2017]. Education also provides the accomplishment of reproductive intentions by providing access to information on modern contraceptive measures and through support to scientific knowledge [@cleland_wilson1987;@jejeebhoy1995]. 

The massification of educational systems also delivers substantial indirect effects over the population fertility levels. We can mention the increasing social costs of childbearing, promoted by schools and formal education through the cultural changes and the propagation of Western middle class values in the educational institutions [@aries1978;@caldwell1980;@folbre1983;@caldwell2006]. One can also argue that higher schooled women have higher probabilities of formal labor market participation, which incurs lower opportunity costs of childbearing than their lower educated counterparts [@becker1993;@goldin_katz2002;@adsera2018]. In addition, the population’s formal schooling is a key element in the comprehension of fertility timing [@bongaarts2003; @chackiel_schkolnik2003] and its constraints [@adsera2018]. In most social settings, social elites are the forerunners of reproductive control, due to their higher schooling levels achieved and increased access to modern contraceptive methods [@cleland_wilson1987].  In addition, some argue that the diffusion of new reproductive behavior from high social groups to lower socioeconomic strata in the society sparks the generalization of the fertility decline [@cleland_wilson1987;@bongaarts2003].

In the context of Brazil, by the time of fertility transition started, its educational system expansion was already ongoing, fomented by a drift shift in economic and production model adopted by the country [@romanelli1986]. By the 1930s, Brazil shifted from a rural society — with an economic model based on the export of agricultural goods — to an urban population with an increasing import substitution industry [@merrick_graham1981; @paiva1987]. The Brazilian formal schooling expansion occurred, however, at a slower pace than other countries in South America [@komatsu_etal2017. Prior to 1930, the pressure for the expansion of educational systems were restricted to minor political groups as a result of the country’s rural economy characteristics, described by its cities’ geographic disconnection and by an obsolete agricultural productive system [@merrick_graham1981;@romanelli1986;@wood_carvalho1988]. As a result, the country only reached the universalization of primary education by 1990 decade [@castro1998].

The rupture between dominant political classes promoted a gradual transformation in the country’s economy [@merrick_graham1981]. In time, Brazil’s productive model shifted from an economy based on exports of agricultural goods to an economic model partially based on urban centers and import substitution industries [@merrick_graham1981; romanelli1986]. The capitalist industrial economic model requires a massive educational system to provide productive and consumption capacity for its success [@romanelli1986]. In this sense, this change in production model of the country resulted in a redesign of the country's educational policies. 

Along the history, this process of schooling expansion did not follow a linear development through education levels. For example, primary education has received lower investments for its expansion than secondary or tertiary education [@romanelli1986;@kang2017;@komatsu_etal2017]. This was partly explained by the adopted education administration structure between government entities. The administration of primary educational systems was under the country's states and municipal accountability, whereas the financial resources were centralized in the federal government [@kang2011], and this last was also responsible for the tertiary education regulation. Therefore, urbanized industrial municipalities (in the South and Southeast) had more resources to invest in primary education than underfunded areas (from North and Northeast), and that reflects later in the structural inequalities that are still exposed over the country [@barros_mendonca1995; @komatsu_etal2017; @merrick_graham1981; @wood_carvalho1988].

Consequently, the main transformations in the educational policy in the period from 1930 to 1960 were targeted to prepare the population for an urban-industrial economic model. This was fostered by the foundation of Ministry of Education and Health in 1931, followed by the creation of the National Institute of Pedagogy (which now is the National Institute for Educational Studies and Research “Anísio Teixeira”), the National Institute of Geography and Statistics (responsible for country’s statistics and national censuses), and national services of industrial and commercial education [@marcilio2014]. In 1961, the first Law of Directives and Bases of National Education, reviewed in 1971, set up the obligation of basic education to the whole population, and established the bases of the current educational system of the country, composed by primary and secondary compulsory schooling [@marcilio2014]. From 1970 to 2000, Brazil experienced relevant increases in enrollment rates in all educational levels [@komatsu_etal2017], and in the 1990s the country finally achieved universal primary schooling enrollment [@castro1998].

The educational composition of the Brazilian population changed over the course of the Twenty century [@figoli2006] Women were significantly affected by this educational expansion. At the beginning, females benefited of schooling gains through a sex-stratified educational system, in which they received instruction to operate in specific labor sectors such as health, hospitality and education [@besse1999]. This process affected female labor market status and created wage inequalities between men and women, but it also fostered women the opportunity to leave private spaces (household or family) and to participate more in the public spheres of the society (public spaces such as commerce and labor market) [@azevedo_ferreira2006; @maluf_mott1998].

In sum, female schooling resulted in the reversion of male educational advantages [@beltrao_alves2009], and it has promoted important transformations in gender relations and social norms of the country through the course of the Twenty century [@itaborai2015]. As results, we saw an increasing participation of women in the labor market [@scorzafave2001] and their larger attendance in secondary and tertiary education [@godinho_etal2006]. Notwithstanding, higher school enrollments led to significant changes in educational composition of the population [@figoli2006], notably for women. Through the course of the country fertility transition, women achieved higher educational gains than men [@beltrao_alves2009; @ribeiro_silva2009], which endorsed decreases of educational hypergamy (matrimonial profiles in which male partners have higher educational attainment level than their female partners) as consequence [@ribeiro_silva2009].

## Assortative matching trends in Brazil

The population’s assortative matching patterns depends to a great extent on the heterogeneity of social characteristics of its individuals [@blau_schwartz1997]. Conjugal unions represent an opportunity of social interaction among distinguished social groups, but this interaction depends on the matrimonial market’s composition and the size of each group in question [@kalmijn1998]. In this context of study,  educational composition of conjugal markets plays an important role and are usually analyzed by demographers due to some important advantages over other socioeconomic indicators such as income. Besides its importance in shaping an individual's life course, preferences and professional realizations, education attainment is usually stable over time for adults. Individual income, on the other hand, is volatile and sensitive to macroeconomic fluctuations [@warren1966;@mare1991;@kalmijn1998;@esteve_etal2012_1]. 

The schools are the environment that shapes social networks among individuals, in which union formation generally takes place [@warren1966;@eckland1968]. Therefore, the massification of formal education is one of the drivers of the biased (and sometimes unconscious) allocation of couples in matrimonial formation. In general, matrimonial unions take place between people of similar educational levels, due to closer social contact of school classmates and the shared human capital formation [@kalmijn1998]. The college educated couples give a good example of high homogamy (unions of individuals with similar characteristics) rates around the world, since these individuals have spent most of their youth in the educational system with similar peers [@mare1991], favoring a posterior matrimonial formation.

The educational composition changes in Brazilian society were not only responsible for fertility decline [@lam_etal1992],, but it had also major effects on the patterns of the country's assortative matching [@ribeiro_silva2009]. Both educational hypogamy (couples in which females have higher education level than their partners) and educational hypergamy (couples in which females have lower education level than their partners) increased expressively from 1970 to 2010. Although, educational hypogamy increased at a higher pace due to female accelerated educational gains in the same period considered [@esteve_mcaa2007;@ribeiro_silva2009;@esteve_etal2012_1]. The prevalence of educational homogamy (couples with the same educational level), on the other hand, has decreased over the time [@esteve_mcaa2007;@ribeiro_silva2009]. 

In Brazil, the homogamous mating has a major prevalence between lower educated social groups, and its reduction rates can be attributed to the expansion of the country’s educational system [@ribeiro_silva2009]. On the other hand, highly schooled couples also show high educational homogamy rates [@esteve_mcaa2007;@ribeiro_silva2009], and that fact shed light on the existing societal barriers in disfavor of the social interactions between groups of different educational backgrounds [@torche2010]. For this reason, in a context of changing gender norms and diversifying assortative mating profiles, it is essential to consider the characteristics of both partners and to evaluate their role on fertility schedules across societies [@nitsche_etal2018].
  

## Reproductive decision making and family conflicts

Despite its relevant role in population reproduction, male and female interactions in fertility decision making have been scarcely analysed in demography [@nitsche_etal2018]. Generally in reproductive studies, males are left out of fertility analysis [@oliveira_etal1994;@goldscheider_kaufman1996;@vanbavel2017]. It happens due to the lack of information on male’s reproductive intentions and behavior in most data [@schoumaker2019]. However, one can argue that males interfere in family size, because of their important role on resource allocation inside the household and in family planning decisions [@thomson1997].  In addition, the evaluation of male’s characteristics in reproduction of couples gains importance in a period of changing in gender relations, cultural norms, family relations and assortative matching patterns.

The Western trend of female schooling expansion, followed by increased demand of women labor force and the reduction of social costs of reproduction, led to the first phase of the Gender Revolution [@goldscheider_etal2015]. This phase is marked by the increased participation of women in the public life and institutional spheres [@goldin2006;@esping-andersen2009;@england2010]. The second phase of this revolution (yet in course) would be guided by an increase in male’s participation in the private sphere, e. g. in household chores and childbearing decisions [@esping-andersen2009]. An optimistic view of this second phase expects a new balance of gender relations in the near future, with lower constraints to female reproduction and greater commitment of male partners to childbearing and domestic activities [@myrskyla_etal2011;@goldscheider_etal2015]. Yet, neither the increments in female participation in public spaces nor the higher achieved women schooling levels led to improvements in sexual division of labor within families [@england2010]. 

In Brazil, the female participation in the labor market resulted in a double burden, especially for the most vulnerable social classes that are unable to acquire domestic and child rearing services from the private market [@guedes2015;@itaborai2016]. Moreover, these social constraints induced women to undertake different strategies to conciliate their labor activities with social motherhood responsibilities (household chores and childbearing). For example, they often choose to work on part-time jobs [@england2010;guedes2015]; they leave formal labor or opt for jobs in the informal market [@teixeira2014]. In contrast to them, high socioeconomic strata women dedicate lower time to household chores, due to their easy access to home care services in the private sector, or because they prefer to invest in their jobs instead of family, or due to the fact that, in general, their highly educated males partners tend to be more active in domestic activities [@itaborai2016].

Taking all that into consideration, in the next sections, we will try to analyze past Brazilian cohort fertility developments, using distinguished couples' educational pairings as a tool to measure male's influence on the general family fertility.

# Data and Methods

## Data

We use data collected via IPUMS-International from Brazilian National Censuses of 1970, 1980, 1991, 2000 and 2010, conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE, from Portuguese *Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística*).). The IPUMS data is harmonized in time and space, which allows for comparison of different demographic scenarios and areas without the need for compatibilization [@esteve_sobek2003;@ipums2018].

With the available information in the censuses, we have identified the educational level of household members, number of children ever born to each woman in the household and their respective partners. This identification is done through the following variables: household serial number, marital status and relationship with the household head. These three pieces of information permitted us to pair women with their respective partners, and to link the couple's educational attainment level information with the number of children ever born. We used educational attainment levels available in four levels at IPUMS: 1) Less than Primary Education (LP), 2) Complete Primary Education (P), 3) Complete Secondary Education (S) and 4) Complete Tertiary Education (T). 

The couples were identified based on the information of each individual marital status and its relationship with the head of the household. We chose to evaluate either formal or consensual unions, because cohabitation historically has spread through diverse social groups in Brazil, and it responds for a non-negligible share of observed fertility levels [@esteve_etal2012_1;@laplante_etal2015;@vieira2016]. Despite the formal matrimonial and the consensual unions are displaying different age-specific fertility profiles [@vieira_alves2016] and different fertility levels [@vieira2016], they do not exhibit significant differentials in terms of assortative mating patterns [@esteve_mcaa2007].

By taking the difference between census reference period and women age, we could estimate cohort fertility rates (CFR) for Brazil and selected regions. We restricted female ages to the range from 40 to 69 years old, and male ages to the range of 35 to 79. We considered that by the age of 40 years old, women would already have completed or would be close to complete their reproductive cycle. This women's age ranges make it possible to reconstruct cohorts born between the years 1901 until 1970. However, we restrict our analysis to the born cohorts between the years 1925-1969, because of data quality issues related to memory misstatements of number of children ever born among older women [@brass_etal1968], and due to data contiguity issues for this older cohorts educational groups [@monteiro-da-silva2019]. For men, we chose a broader age range to increase the number of couples' observations, allowing males to be older than the women but also to include the couples in which men are younger than their partners.

Improbable and unreliable number of children ever born statements were also addressed prior to the estimation of CFRs. Hence, we assumed that women can bear only one living child each 18 months, starting from age 12 [@moultrie_etal2013]. Following this rule of thumb, at the age of 15 years old, it is expected that women have a maximum of two kids; at 20 years of age, they bore a maximum of five children, and so on. Thus, when the stated number of children ever born exceeded this threshold expected parity, for a given woman's age, we set its value to the maximum expected number of offspring, according to the expected mother’s age, following this rule of thumb.

Finally, we also analyzed cohort fertility taken into account the regional socioeconomic disparities of the country, thus, we grouped CRFs into 3 regions: 1) Midwest, 2) South-Southeast and 3) North-Northeast. These groups were chosen based on similar socioeconomic characteristics, shared characteristics of cohort fertility, as well as the assortative mating verified in previous analysis [@monteiro-da-silva2019].This grouping facilitates managing scale issues of small sample sizes in regions of lower population density and lower population counts of particular educational groups. Notwithstand, the general Brazilian fertility decline also followed this regional grouping [@goncalves_etal2019].

## Cohort fertility trends of educational pairings

Assuming the mentioned conditions and the educational categories, we estimated cohort fertility rates for each educational pairing profile by:

$$ CFR_{F,M}^{t} = \frac{CHBORN_{F,M}^{t}} {W_{F,M}^{t}} $$ 

Where,

* $CFR_{F,M}^{t}$: Cohort Fertility Rates for cohorts of women born in time t with an educational attainment level F married/in-union with a partner that reached an educational attainment level M;

* $CHBORN_{F,M}^{t}$: Children Ever Born to cohorts of women born in time t with an educational attainment level F married/in-union with a partner that reached an educational attainment level M;

* $W_{F,M}^{t}$: Total number of women from the cohort born in time t with an educational attainment level F married/in-union with a partner that reached an educational attainment level M.

We compute CFRs in two ways for different methodological evaluations. First, we estimate CFRs for each educational pairing of women born cohorts, ranging from the years 1925-1969, grouped in five-year age groups and educational levels LP, P and S+ (secondary or tertiary education completed). The last two educational levels were grouped in order to avoid small sample size problems and noise CFRs estimates, due to few people with tertiary educational attainment levels from older cohorts.

The CFR trends were then evaluated in terms of both males' and females' educational attainment levels, as a way to visualize how each partner's schooling influences Brazilian regional fertility developments. 

## Decomposition of CFRs by educational pairing

In a second moment, we computed CFR for three female cohorts corresponding to a 15 year time interval. We divided these cohorts according to phases of schooling expansion, for men and women, and their correspondent fertility transition phase as described below:

* Cohorts born between the years 1925-39: older female cohorts, forerunners of the processes of fertility decline in the country and they have experienced the intensification of female schooling  [@azevedo_ferreira2006];

* Cohorts born between the years 1940-54: women born in a period of educational system expansion and who are still presenting lower schooling levels than men [@beltrao_alves2009]. These women, however, responded for a large share of fertility decline in decades of 1960-80, influenced by the diffusion of modern contraceptive methods [@merrick_berquo1983;@carvalho_wong1992;@goldin_katz2002];

* Cohorts born between the years 1955-1969: younger female cohorts that have achieved higher schooling levels than men, and have experienced higher labor market participation rates than previous female cohorts [@lam_etal1992; @scorzafave2001; @beltrao_alves2009]. 

Taking more cohorts into consideration made it possible to evaluate even the tertiary education influence on cohort fertility, and decompose the effects of educational expansion and changing conjugal profiles in fertility by comparing each cohort group separately. We apply a demographic decomposition method [@dasgupta1993], performed by@yoo2014, to assess both influence of educational pairings (*composition effects*) and cohort (*rate effects*) on fertility differentials ($ \Delta CFR $). 

The overall CFR for a given period T is computed by:

$$ CFR^T = \sum_i^{ep} CFR^T_{ep} P^T_{ep} $$ 

Further, the differences in CFR from time T1 to time T2 are given by:

$$ \Delta CFR_{12} = CFR^{T1} - CFR^{T2}  = \sum_i^{ep} CFR^{T1}_{ep} P^{T1}_{ep} - \sum_i^{ep} CFR^{T2}_{ep} P^{T2}_{ep} $$ 

Where,

* $T$ is the female cohort birth period that assume 3 cohort intervals: T = {1925-39, 1940-54, 1955-69};

* $ep$ is the educational pairing profile, which assumes 16 possible combinations of female and male educational levels (F,M): ep = {(LP,LP), (LP,P), (LP,S), (LP,T), (P,LP), (P,P),
(P,S), (P,T), (S,LP), (S,P), (S,S), (S,T), (T,LP), (T,P), (T,S), (T,T)};

* $P^T_{ep}$ is the proportion of education paired couples for female cohort $T$ with an $ep$ profile.

The cohort fertility differences are estimated pairwise, i.e. between female cohorts born in 1925-39 and 1940-54, between 1940-54 and 1955-69 cohorts, comparing cohorts from 1925-39 to 1955-69. These cohort fertility differentials can be decomposed in compositional effects of marriage markets, which are related to changes in educational pairings distribution, and rate effects, related to changes in CFR specific for each educational pairing (see @dasgupta1993 [p. 37] for details on decomposition of rates as functions of two vector-factors). Therefore:

$$ \Delta CFR_{1,2} = \Delta CFR_{1,2}^{\text{effect}} + \Delta P_{1,2}^{\text{effect}} $$ 

We can evaluate compositional differences in terms of changing matrimonial educational profiles among female cohorts and the other unobserved effects that affect CFRs among each educational profile of couples.

## Limitations of analysis

The national census data have some limitations for our methodological approaches. First, they do not provide information about the duration of past unions and their influence on reproductive levels of women. Thus, we assume that women conceived all the declared children (or most of them) inside the matrimonial unions reported at the time of the census inquiries. An increase in the number of divorces (or re-marriages) through time in Brazil is likely to influence our estimates [@camarano2014, pp. 146]. However, the union dissolution rates in the country have been considerably stable at the low values of 0.5 and 1%, from the 1980s until the beginning of the 2000s [@ibge2014], which in turn causes little harm to our analyses.  

Second, only cohabiting couples from the same household are considered in the estimates, because the Brazilian censuses do not allow the construction of family ties from different households. Therefore, usually for economic reasons, couples may live apart, a feature commonly observed in the Northeast region [@maluf_mott1998],  and we may miss some reproductive information of women whose partners were not living in the same household, during the census inquiries. Actually, this migration effect in lower developed areas is higher for cohorts born in periods of intense migration flows, from North-Northeast in direction to Southeast region, as a result of the industrialization process [@singer1973]. We tried to reduce this migration effect by grouping the geographical areas into big regions. Notwithstand, the period of intense intern migration in the country ended 1960 (references), affecting mostly the older cohorts born from 1925-39. Even though, as expected, these last cohorts are still presenting the highest levels of fertility in the North-Northeast regions compared to the rest of the country, meaning that migration might affect the fertility education pairing estimates, but this effect is not too big.

# Results

## Educational pairings cohort fertility trends in Brazil

We first turn our attention to analyse cohort fertility trends of educational pairings following CFR of five-year grouped female cohorts for Brazil and its grouped regions (figure 1). Each panel of figure 1 presents a fixed educational attainment level for females and each line represents the male partner's educational attainment level. Thus, distances between lines of the same graph (panel) represent fertility differentials among male partners educational categories.

For the country as a whole, we observe marked fertility differentials for both male and female partners between different female birth cohorts. For older female cohorts, couples with at least one partner without complete primary school presented higher fertility levels than other pairings. Male partners low educational levels seems to have contributed to slow down fertility transition process. This is noted by the high CFRs estimated for older female cohorts with partners of the least educational attainment level. However, increasing female education through cohorts minimized differences of CFR between male partner's educational categories and fomented the transition process [@merrick_berquo1983]. Female education increase bargaing power and autonomy of women in family decision making [@jejeebhoy1995]. Therefore, women of higher schooling have reproductive profiles less attached to their husband's educational characteristics and more related to females own socioeconomic status and perceived opportunity costs of reproduction [@becker1993].

This fertility differentials among educational categories of men and women diminishes for younger female cohorts. This converging fertility trend is a result of multiple factors. First, the reduction of illiteracy [@figoli2006] itself plays a key role in reproductive control adoption [@martin_juarez1995;@perpetuo_wajnman1998;@perpetuo_wong2009], however, it does not necessarily result in individual completion of primary school. Further, unexpected effects of institutional reforms of the Brazilian state between 1970-1990 decades fostered changes in social and cultural norms of the Brazilian society which increased female autonomy in family planning [@faria1989;@martine1996;@faria1997]. This transformations in Brazilian society were related to the development of a communications system infrastructure, which connected distant regions of the country and contributed for the difusion of higher social strata reproductive behavior through soap operas [@faria_potter1999;@laferrara_etal2012], and to the medicalization of female population, which led to higher adoption of contraceptive methods even by the most vulnerable social groups [@martine1996;@faria1997;@perpetuo_wajnman1998;@perpetuo_wong2009].

Central-West region presented a conjugal CFR transition similar to the one observed for the country as a whole. In this region, male scholing showed a stronger influence for women of lower schooling level of older cohorts. Additionally, as women of the region achieved higher schooling levels, the partner's educational differentials diminished and CFRs get closer to replacement fertility levels. Younger cohorts exhibit similar CFR values for all educational categories of the partner and converging towards replacement levels. 

North and Northeast regions started their conjugal CFRs transitions from values above 8 children per women for lower educated groups. In these regions, male partner's fertility differentials were abserved between all educational categories, especially for the transitions from uncompleted to completed primary school categories. The increase of females educational levels in North-Northeast is followed by a reduction of fertility levels but not by a reduction of male partner's educational differentials. 

We especulate that female reproductive autonomy in these regions are lower or they present lower opportunity costs to reproductive control [@becker1993;@jejeebhoy1995], and thus, the partner's education acts as an important driver of fertility levels through a higher involvement of educated males in family planning decisions [@oliveira_etal2002]. Furthermore, the converging trends of fertility levels of pairings with lower educated males is weaker in these areas. A possible explanation is that these regions were not completely integrated to the new urban-industrial economy that was established in São Paulo due to theirs export-agricultural roots and ruling local elites [@singer1973;@merrick_graham1981]. In this sense, we observe lower formal labor market engagement of women in these areas [@goncalves_etal2004;@barbosa2014] which result in lower social constraints to reproduction [@patarra_oliveira1988]. We may say North and Northeast were under influence of a patriarchal family model [@aguiar2000] with lower participation of women in the public sphere of society which incurred in lower autonomy in family planning and hence in a higher fertility level [@becker1993;@folbre1994].

South and Southeast areas started their conjugal cohort fertility transition from lower CFR levels than other areas of the country - less than 6 children per women for least educated groups. Male partner differentials are lower than those observed in other areas even for women with incomplete primary school. We especulate that this is a result of school expansion (reduction of illiteracy) and transition of economic model to the urban-industrial model, centered in São Paulo area, what demanded more educated labor force and female participation in the labor market [@singer1973;@romanelli1986]. As this processes took off in São Paulo state, these areas of the country were the first ones to experience fertility decline due to new rising social norms of urban centers [@guzman_rodriguez1993]. Moreover, these regions were also influenced by European and Japanese migration streams from 1850 until 1940s [@singer1973], areas where fertility control was already practiced [@coale1986]. Finally, younger female cohorts with complete secondary school show below replacement fertility levels independently of the partner's educational level, once more supporting the argument that education favors female reproductive autonomy [@jejeebhoy1995].

Next, we will investigate the differences observe between cohort observed differentials. By considering larger intervals of birth cohort groups, we may evaluate compositional effects of educational pairings on fertility transition.

<!-- This convergence process is observed in figure 2, which presents the relative differences between the extreme educational categories (LP and S+) from the intermediate educational category (P). Relative differences between male educational categories are stable through female cohorts and educational categories, with the exception for the differences observed between males with complete and incomlpete primary schooling married with women with incomplete primary school. -->

## Decomposition of cohort fertility rates 

Tables 1 to 4 present the composition of educational pairings and estimated CFR of each pairing for female birth cohorts born in 1925-39, 1940-54 and 1955-69 for Brazil and regions. 

[Table 1 about here]

We verify that educational homogamy fell in all regions due to decreases in prevalence rates of LP-LP educational pairings. Even though educational homogamy within higher educational categories has increased, it was not sufficient to outnumber the decrease in LP-LP educational pairing prevalence. Hence, homogamy was high in the past because of overall lower levels of education of the population [@esteve_mcaa2007;@ribeiro_silva2009]. Additionally, as women benefited the most from educational expansion [@beltrao_alves2009], Brazil observed considerable compositional changes in population educaitonal levels [@figoli2006] and the prevalence of hipogamic couples rose significantly over the period as hipergamy showed a steady decline [@esteve_etal2016].

Nevertheless, regions exhibit different trends in educational pairing composition. Central-West region performs similar trends to Brazil, transiting from high lower schooling homogamy to a dispersed profile with higher prevalence of hipogamic couples.

North-Northeast regions had a slower transition from high low education homogamy rates to higher heterogamy rates. Actually, the lower educated groups still responded for almost 50% of educational pairings for 1955-69 female cohorts. Also, hipogamic couples were already on the rise for intermediate cohorts as females from North-Northeast had overtaken educational levels of men before than other regions [@monteiro-da-silva2019]. This lagged process of homogamy decrease and the observation of hipogamic couples for older cohorts are the result of regional inequalities of the country. These Northern areas presented a later shift to industrial and service based economy and  higher inequality levels. Thus, there was a lower market demand for schooling of the usually male workers of the primary sector whom, due to income inequalities, had few alternatives rather than working in the informal lower paid markets [@merrick_graham1981; @wood_carvalho1988; @romanelli1986]. Therefore, women had easier access to schooling since they usually performed household or professional activities that were more compatible with formal education, such as teacher formation schools [@azevedo_ferreira2006;@guedes2015].

The Southern areas of the country observed the most intense compositional changes in educational pairings. They presented the lowest lower education homogamy levels of the country and a later process of hipogamy increase. These regions benefited the most from educational expansion, and therefore, they observed the highest increase of heterogamic couples' prevalence rates. The region was the forerunner of the educational expansion due to the industrialization process [@komatsu_etal2017]. The industrial labor market is male-dominated and requires technical skills achieved through professional education [@romanelli1986]. Hence, this higher educated male population of the Sourthern regions resulted in the later process of hipogamy increase.

Table 5 present the overall CFR for these three cohorts for each region and also the results of decomposition exercises. In general, for Brazil and its regions, most of the reduction of conjugal CFRs were driven by unobservable effects of rate decline (70%). Most of these rate effects are explanied by the works of @faria1989 and @martine1996, which we have already mentioned. The remaining 30% of the differences among older and younger cohorts are explained by changes in educational pairing composition. So, a substantial part of the cohort fertility decline of the country occurred as a result of educational expansion and schooling not only for women, but also for men. This compositional effect is concentrated in the reduction of lower education homogamy.

[Table 5 about here]

In this sense, male's educational attainment also contributes for fertility reduction, since more education means more commitment of men to household activities [@mcdonald2000;@esping-andersen2009] and this lowers contraints to female reproduction and promotes the fulfillment of fertility intentions [@folbre1994]. In regions where the education expansion of males lagged in relation to others (North-Northeast), fertility transition was slower and females reproductive autonomy was also weaker due to cultural aspects and prevailing patriarchal social norms of the region in the past [@folbre1983;@aguiar2000].
