# Abstract

## BACKGROUND
The fertility transition in Brazil was the result of multiple socioeconomic transformations that initiated from 1930s on-wards. The education expansion plays an important role in this process by promoting changes in social norms and in assortative matching profiles.

## OBJECTIVE
This paper estimates effects of male partners' education on reproductive behavior of couples for Brazil and its regions during the process of fertility transition, taking into account the effects of changes in educational pairings composition.

## METHODS
We compute cohort fertility rates (CFRs) for groups of educational pairings, considering the female cohorts born between the years 1925-1969. The CFRs decline were decomposed between compositional and rate effects using @dasgupta1993 decomposition methods. 

## RESULTS
In the country, the couple's CFR fell from 6.30 to 2.94 between the analyzed cohorts. Educational pairing composition accounted for approximately 30% of these changes in cohort fertility. Increases in male schooling, especially the jump from incomplete to complete primary education, resulted in significant CFRs reductions, even controlling for female schooling levels.

## CONCLUSIONS
Results suggest that males' education does affect family size, especially considering older cohorts couples. Additionally, we argue that to a certain extent, a slower male educational expansion might have restrained the pace of fertility transition in some regions of the country.

## CONTRIBUTION
The cohort analysis and male schooling influences on family size represent good tools to understand Brazilian fertility transition, and it also provides new perspectives of analyses for other Latin American countries that have experienced a similar reproductive decline process.

# 1. Introduction

Brazil observed a significant reduction of its total fertility rates since 1960s [@merrick_berquo1983] and by 2010-2015 the country was already under below-replacement fertility levels [@berquo_cavenaghi2014;@castanheira_kohler2015;@lima_etal2018;@rios-neto_etal2018]. The country's fertility transition was marked by heterogeneous starting, timing and pace across its regions and socioeconomic strata [@potter_etal2010]. 

The pioneers of the fertility decline were social groups with higher socioeconomic status, especially those living in urban and industrialized areas of South and Southeast of the country; they were forerunners in the practice of birth control, which took place before the beginning of the generalized decline of fertility in the 1960s [@merrick_berquo1983;@guzman_rodriguez1993;@goncalves_etal2019]. In opposition to the steady and gradual fertility transition of developed nations, the contraceptive behavior rapidly spread from groups of higher social status to groups of lower socioeconomic status of Northern and Northeastern parts of Brazil [@carvalho_wong1992;@perpetuo_wajnman1998;@berquo_cavenaghi2014]. To illustrate, in these two regions, social groups of lower schooling levels and lower household income started to experience a fertility decline by the 1980s, but at a much accelerated pace than similar groups from other regions, where the fertility decline commenced twenty years earlier [@potter_etal2002;@potter_etal2010].

Several factors explain the converging fertility regimes among social groups and, thus, the fast pace of fertility transition in Brazil. We can mention industrialization and urbanization, changes in labor market and productive structures, reduction of infant mortality rates, higher access to formal schooling followed by a higher rates of female participation in the labor market, changes in gender relations, expansion of consumer society and communication systems among other factors related to socioeconomic and technological development [@merrick_berquo1983; @paiva1987;@faria1989;@oliveira1989;@lam_etal1992;@alves1994;@martine1996;@potter_etal2002;@castanheira_kohler2017;@rios-neto_etal2018]. Notwithstanding, the difference in paces and periods that each region experienced the fertility transition can be attributed to an uneven spread of these processes through the country, resulting in non-negligible demographic inequalities [@wood_carvalho1988;@patarra_oliveira1988;@carvalho_brito2005;@wong_carvalho2006].  

Despite the relevance of all these variables, we may argue that the expansion of population's access to education was one of the main drivers of the fertility transition in Brazil [@merrick_berquo1983;@lam_etal1992;@carvalho_wong1992], especially in more recent periods. Education exerts direct and indirect influences on demographic processes by shaping the life course of individuals through human capital formation [@lutz2010]. For instance, recent trends in rising female educational attainment brought higher female participation in the labor market and fostered the postponement of childbearing [@neels_etal2017]. Recent rising educational attainment movements throughout the globe also promoted changes in the composition of conjugal markets and assortative mating profiles of countries [@mare1991;@esteve_mcaa2007;@ribeiro_silva2009]. At last, education plays an important role in regard to individual's social and gender norms, encouraging new ideals of family size and cooperation between partners in the household realm [@jejeebhoy1995;@mcdonald2000;@esping-andersen2009;@adsera2018]. 

Recently, demography scholars have been exploring cohort fertility and male fertility as methodological approaches to study fertility trends in the context of postponement of childbearing [@sobotka2004;@bixby_etal2009;@neels_etal2017], rising female schooling [@esping-andersen2009;@neels_etal2017;@vanbavel_etal2018] and its effects on changing gender norms, family commitment and reproductive behavior  [@mcdonald2000;@esping-andersen2009;@goldscheider_etal2015;@adsera2018]. Yet, neither of these approaches have been broadly explored for the Brazilian fertility context.
 
We estimate cohort fertility levels in Brazil by using census or household surveys, because the country does not dispose of longitudinal data to track down life course demographic processes. Using the respondent's age and the inquiry reference date information of multiple Brazilian national censuses (1970, 1980, 1991, 2000 and 2010), we reconstruct birth cohorts and its reproductive indicators (mean children ever born) and make associations with the urbanization, industrialization and schooling expansion processes that took place in the country throughout the second half of the XX century. Afterwards, by linking female's reproductive data with the schooling level of their partners, we assess the associations between male education and reproductive behavior of couples during the course of the country's fertility transition. Our analysis also reports regional cohort fertility trends to account for historical diverging regional fertility transition processes.

This work fosters important discussions and make valuable contributions for Brazilian fertility transition studies. First of all, few works evaluate cohort fertility trends throughout the process of educational expansion in the country. Additionally, this work incorporates the discussion of contributions of partners' education to the completed fertility levels of couples [@thomson1997;@vanbavel2017;@nitsche_etal2018]. In this sense, this analysis shed light on processes of fertility transition that have been promoting changes in gender norms and in family structure for several generations. Merging the perspectives of cohort changes and partners' education to fertility analysis might provide new insights and spark new research questions in Brazilian fertility transition studies. 

# 2. Background

## 2.1 Fertility decline and school expansion in Brazil

The fertility transition in Brazil have been well documented by several studies. This process was marked by contrasting fertility regimes among distinguished socioeconomic groups, as for example, highly educated social groups already adopted birth control practices prior to the onset of a generalized decline of the country's fertility levels [@merrick_berquo1983]. A second noteworthy characteristic is that, compared to more developed regions, the fertility rates from different social strata converged into replacement fertility levels in a short period of time [@berquo_cavenaghi2014] and, more recently, the overall TFR reached below population replacement levels [@castanheira_kohler2015]. 


The diffusion of new contraceptive methods - in particular, female sterilization and the contraceptive pill - contributed for the rapid transition and the fertility convergence processes [@merrick_berquo1983;@martine1996;@perpetuo_wajnman1998;@perpetuo_wong2009]. There were, however, differences in contraceptive behavior between social groups that illustrate the social inequalities within the access to family planning [@carvalho_brito2005]. Groups of lower socioeconomic status had access to more harmful contraceptive methods (sterilization and clandestine abortion), whereas wealthier families could consume other safer options, and opted for female sterilization only when their family size goals was achieved [@faria1997; @martine1996; @perpetuo_wajnman1998; @perpetuo_wong2009]. Nowadays, despite similar fertility levels, these social groups differ in fertility timing, for example, females with lower schooling levels display younger mean ages at first child and fertility postponement is more common among women with completed higher education [@rios-neto_etal2018; @lima_etal2018].

In common, these studies show how education has become one and, if not, the most important key element to determine fertility outcomes in Brazil. Schooling acts as a strong determinant of reproductive behavior of women through several mechanisms [@jejeebhoy1995]. Moreover, formal education affects females' exposure to childbearing by shaping both labor market participation and conjugal decisions [@martin_juarez1995; @neels_etal2017]. Additionally, education also helps to provide the accomplishment of reproductive intentions, by promoting the access to information on modern contraceptive methods and other relevant scientific knowledge [@cleland_wilson1987;@jejeebhoy1995].

By the time of fertility transition started in Brazil, its educational system expansion was already ongoing, fomented by a shift in the economic and production model adopted by the country [@romanelli1986]. The rupture between dominant political classes promoted a gradual transformation in the country's economy and social environment [@merrick_graham1981;@paiva1987]. In time, Brazil's productive model shifted from an economy based on exports of agricultural goods to an economic model partially based on urban centers growing service sector and import substitution industries which fomented the urbanization of the country and, in particular, of the Southeastern state of São Paulo [@merrick_graham1981;singer1973]. 

The main transformations in the educational policy from 1930 to 1960 were targeted to expand the educational system to provide productive and consumption capacity for an urban-industrial economic model [@romanelli1986]. This movement began with the foundation of Ministry of Education and Health in 1931, followed by the creation of the National Institute of Pedagogy (which now is the National Institute for Educational Studies and Research "Anísio Teixeira"), the National Institute of Geography and Statistics (responsible for country's statistics and national censuses), and national services of industrial and commercial education [@marcilio2014]. In 1961, the first Law of Directives and Bases of National Education, reviewed in 1971, set up the obligation of basic education to the whole population, and established the bases of the current educational system of the country, composed by primary and secondary compulsory schooling [@marcilio2014]. From 1970 to 2000, Brazil experienced relevant increases in enrollment rates across all educational levels [@komatsu_etal2017], and in the 1990s the country finally achieved universal primary schooling enrollment [@castro1998].

The Brazilian formal schooling expansion occurred, however, at a slower pace than in other South American countries and was not evenly distributed across educational levels [@komatsu_etal2017]. For example, primary education has received lower investments for its expansion than secondary or tertiary education [@romanelli1986;@kang2017;@komatsu_etal2017]. This was partly explained by the adopted education administration structure between government entities. The administration of primary educational systems was under states and municipal accountability, while the financial resources were centralized at a federal government level [@kang2011], which was also responsible for the regulation of the tertiary education system. Therefore, urbanized industrial municipalities (in the South and Southeast) had more resources to invest in primary education than underfunded areas (from North and Northeast), which later reflected in structural inequalities that are still visible in the country to this day [@barros_mendonca1995; @komatsu_etal2017; @merrick_graham1981; @wood_carvalho1988].

Therefore, the educational composition of the Brazilian population changed over the course of the XX century [@figoli2006]. In special, women were significantly affected by this educational expansion. At first, females benefited from schooling gains through a gender-stratified educational system, in which they received instruction to operate in specific labor sectors such as health, hospitality and education [@besse1999]. This process affected the female labor market structure and status, creating persisting wage inequalities between men and women, but it also fostered women the opportunity to leave their household and to participate more in the public spheres of the society (public spaces such as commerce and labor market) [@azevedo_ferreira2006; @maluf_mott1998].

In sum, female schooling resulted in the reversion of male educational advantages [@beltrao_alves2009], and it has promoted important transformations in gender relations and social norms of the country through the course of the XX century [@itaborai2015]. As a result, we saw an increasing participation of women in the labor market [@scorzafave2001] and a larger female attendance in secondary and tertiary education [@godinho_etal2006]. In the course of the country's fertility transition women achieved higher educational gains than men [@beltrao_alves2009; @ribeiro_silva2009], which consequently propelled a decrease in educational hypergamy - conjugal profiles in which male partners have higher educational attainment level than their female partners [@ribeiro_silva2009].

## 2.2 Assortative mating trends in Brazil

The population's assortative mating patterns depends to a great extent on the heterogeneity of social characteristics of its individuals [@blau_schwartz1997]. Conjugal unions represent an opportunity of social interaction between distinct social groups, but this interaction depends on the conjugal market's composition and the size of each group [@kalmijn1998]. In this context, educational composition of conjugal markets plays an important role and are usually analyzed by demographers due to some important advantages over other socioeconomic indicators such as income. Besides its importance in shaping an individual's life course, preferences and professional realizations, education attainment is usually stable over time for adults. Individual income, on the other hand, is volatile and sensitive to macroeconomic fluctuations [@warren1966;@mare1991;@kalmijn1998;@esteve_etal2012_1]. 

Schools form the environment that shapes social networks among individuals and in which union formation generally takes place [@warren1966;@eckland1968]. Therefore, the massification of formal education is one of the drivers of the biased (and sometimes unconscious) allocation of couples in conjugal formation. In general, unions take place between people of similar educational levels, due to closer social contact of school classmates and the shared human capital formation [@kalmijn1998]. College-educated couples are a good example of high homogamy (unions of individuals with similar characteristics) rates around the world, since these individuals have spent most of their youth in the educational system with similar peers [@mare1991], favoring a posterior conjugal union.

The educational composition changes in Brazilian society were not only responsible for fertility decline [@lam_etal1992], but it had also major effects on the country's assortative mating trends [@ribeiro_silva2009]. Both educational hypogamy (couples in which females have higher education level than their partners) and educational hypergamy (couples in which females have lower education level than their partners) increased expressively from 1970 to 2010. Although, educational hypogamy increased at a higher pace due to female accelerated educational gains in the same period considered [@esteve_mcaa2007;@ribeiro_silva2009;@esteve_etal2012_1]. The prevalence of educational homogamy (couples with the same educational level), on the other hand, has decreased over the time [@esteve_mcaa2007;@ribeiro_silva2009]. 

In Brazil, homogamous mating profiles have historically shown a major prevalence between lower educated social groups and its reduction can be attributed to the expansion of the country's educational system [@ribeiro_silva2009]. On the other hand, highly educated couples also show high educational homogamy rates [@esteve_mcaa2007;@ribeiro_silva2009], and that fact shed light on the existing societal barriers in detriment of the social interactions between groups of different educational backgrounds [@torche2010]. For this reason, assessing the characteristics of both partners in the reproductive behavior of couples within a context of changing gender norms and diversifying assortative mating profiles could provide new insights for fertility studies [@nitsche_etal2018].
  
## 2.3 Reproductive decision making and family conflicts

Despite its relevant role in population reproduction, male and female interactions in fertility decision making have been scarcely analyzed in demography [@nitsche_etal2018]. Generally, in reproductive studies, males are left out of fertility analysis [@oliveira_etal1994;@goldscheider_kaufman1996;@vanbavel2017]. It happens due to the lack of information on male's reproductive intentions and behavior in most data sources [@schoumaker2019]. However, one can argue that males interfere in family size, because of their important role on resource allocation inside the household and in family planning decisions [@thomson1997]. In addition, evaluating and studying male's characteristics in the reproductive behavior of couples gained importance in a period of changes in gender relations, cultural norms, family relations and assortative mating patterns.

The Western trend of female schooling expansion, followed by an increased demand for female labor force, was well as the reduction of the social costs of reproduction, led to the first phase of the Gender Revolution [@goldscheider_etal2015]. This phase is marked by the increased participation of women in public life and institutional spheres [@goldin2006;@esping-andersen2009;@england2010]. The second phase of this still ongoing revolution would be guided by an increase in men's participation in the private sphere, e.g. in household chores and childbearing decisions [@esping-andersen2009]. An optimistic view of this second phase expects a new balance of gender relations in the near future, with lower constraints to female reproduction and greater commitment of male partners to childbearing and domestic activities [@myrskyla_etal2011;@goldscheider_etal2015]. Yet, neither the increments in female participation in public spaces nor the higher achieved female schooling levels achieved have led to improvements in division of labor by gender within families [@england2010]. 

Female participation in the Brazilian labor market resulted in a double burden, especially for the most vulnerable social classes that are unable to acquire domestic and child rearing services in the private market [@guedes2015;@itaborai2016]. Moreover, these social constraints have induced women to undertake different strategies to conciliate their labor activities with social motherhood responsibilities (household chores and childbearing). For example, they often choose to work part-time jobs [@england2010; @guedes2015] or they either leave formal labor or opt for jobs in the informal market [@teixeira2014]. In contrast to this group of females, women from higher socioeconomic strata dedicate lower time to household chores, because they have easier access to home care services in the private sector, or due to the fact that highly educated male partners tend to be generally more active and cooperative in domestic activities [@itaborai2016].

Taking all that into consideration, in the next sections, we will analyze past Brazilian cohort fertility trends, using couples' educational pairings as a tool to capture the association of male educational levels on the completed fertility of couples.

# 3. Data and Methods

## 3.1 Data

We use data collected via IPUMS-International from Brazilian National Censuses of 1970, 1980, 1991, 2000 and 2010, conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE, from Portuguese *Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística*). The IPUMS data is harmonized in time and space, which allows for the comparison of different demographic scenarios and areas without the need for compatibilization [@esteve_sobek2003;@ipums2019].

For the construction of educational pairings and for computing the mean number of children ever born or cohort fertility of each pairing we used the following variables [@ipums2019]:

* household serial number (SERIAL);
* person weight (PERWT) - to compute accurate statistics for the population; 
* relationship to household head (RELATE) - to identify the majority of women and its respective partners;
* marital status (MARST) - to identify couples married or in union;
* age (AGE);
* children ever born (CHBORN);
* educational attainment, international recode - available in four levels at IPUMS (besides unknown or not in universe codes): 1) Less than Primary Education (LP), 2) Complete Primary Education (P), 3) Complete Secondary Education (S) and 4) Complete Tertiary Education (T).  

We chose to evaluate either formal or consensual unions, because cohabitation has, historically, spread across different social groups in Brazil and it responds for a relevant share of observed fertility levels [@esteve_etal2012_1;@laplante_etal2015;@vieira2016]. Despite the formal matrimonial and the consensual unions display different age-specific fertility profiles [@vieira_alves2016], as well as different fertility levels [@vieira2016], they do not exhibit significant differentials in terms of assortative mating patterns [@esteve_mcaa2007].

By taking the difference between census reference period and the age of women, we were able to estimate cohort fertility rates (CFR) for Brazil and selected regions. We limited the female age range to 40 to 69 years old, and the male ones to 40 to 79. We considered that, by the age of 40 years old, women would already have completed or would be close to complete their reproductive cycles. This makes it possible to reconstruct cohorts born between 1901 and 1970. However, we restrict our analysis to the cohorts born in the period of 1925-1969, because of data quality issues related to memory misstatements on the number of children ever born from older women [@brass_etal1968], and due to data contiguity issues for these older cohorts educational groups [@monteiro-da-silva2019]. Regarding men, we have chosen a broader age range to increase the number of couples' observations, allowing men to be older than their female partners, which is usually common in Brazilian couples [@vieira_alves2016].

Finally, we also analyzed cohort fertility, taking into account the regional socioeconomic disparities of the country, grouping CRFs into 3 regions: 1) Midwest, 2) South-Southeast and 3) North-Northeast. These groups were chosen based on similar socioeconomic characteristics, shared characteristics of cohort fertility, as well as the assortative mating verified in previous analysis [@monteiro-da-silva2019]. This grouping facilitates managing scale issues of small sample sizes in regions of lower population density and lower population counts of particular educational groups. Notwithstanding, the general Brazilian fertility decline also followed this regional grouping [@goncalves_etal2019].

We provide more details on the sample size and data treatments in the appendix A.

## 3.2 Cohort fertility trends of educational pairings

Assuming the mentioned conditions and the educational categories, we estimated cohort fertility rates for each educational pairing profile by

$$ CFR_{F,M}^{t} = \frac{CHBORN_{F,M}^{t}} {W_{F,M}^{t}}, $$ 

where,

* $CFR_{F,M}^{t}$: Cohort Fertility Rates for cohorts of women born in time t with an educational attainment level F married/in-union with a partner that reached an educational attainment level M;

* $CHBORN_{F,M}^{t}$: Children Ever Born to cohorts of women born in time t with an educational attainment level F married/in-union with a partner that reached an educational attainment level M;

* $W_{F,M}^{t}$: Total number of women from the cohort born in time t with an educational attainment level F married/in-union with a partner that reached an educational attainment level M.

We compute CFRs in two ways for different methodological evaluations. First, we estimate CFRs for each educational pairing of women born cohorts, ranging from the years 1925-1969, grouped in five-year age groups and educational levels LP, P and S+ (secondary or tertiary education completed). The last two educational levels were grouped together in order to avoid small sample size problems and noisy CFRs estimates, due to few people with tertiary educational attainment levels from older cohorts, and to account for limitations of census educational data that shall be discussed in the section 3.4 [@nepomuceno_turra2020].

The CFR trends were then evaluated in terms of both males' and females' educational attainment levels, as a means to visualize how each partner's level of schooling influences the development of regional fertility in Brazil.

## 3.3 Decomposition of CFRs by educational pairing

In a separate instance, we have computed CFR for three female cohorts corresponding to a 15-year time interval. We have divided these cohorts according to phases of schooling expansion, for men and women, and their correspondent fertility transition phase as described below:

* Cohorts born between the years 1925-39: older female cohorts, forerunners of the processes of fertility decline in the country which experienced the intensification of female schooling [@azevedo_ferreira2006];

* Cohorts born between the years 1940-54: women born in a period of educational system expansion and who still presented lower schooling levels than men [@beltrao_alves2009]. These women, however, were responsible for a large share of the fertility decline that took place in the period of 1960-80, through the adoption of modern contraceptive methods [@merrick_berquo1983;@carvalho_wong1992;@goldin_katz2002];

* Cohorts born between the years 1955-1969: younger female cohorts that have achieved higher schooling levels than men, and have experienced higher labor market participation rates than previous female cohorts [@lam_etal1992; @scorzafave2001; @beltrao_alves2009]. 
Taking more cohorts into consideration made it possible to evaluate even the tertiary education influence on cohort fertility, and decompose the effects of educational expansion and changing conjugal profiles in fertility by comparing each cohort group separately. We apply a demographic decomposition method [@dasgupta1993], performed by @yoo2014, to assess both influence of educational pairings (*composition effects*) and cohort (*rate effects*) on fertility differentials ($ \Delta CFR $). 

The overall CFR for a given period T is computed by

$$ CFR^T = \sum_i^{ep} CFR^T_{ep} P^T_{ep}. $$ 

Further, the differences in CFR from time T1 to time T2 are given by

$$ \Delta CFR_{12} = CFR^{T1} - CFR^{T2}  = \sum_i^{ep} CFR^{T1}_{ep} P^{T1}_{ep} - \sum_i^{ep} CFR^{T2}_{ep} P^{T2}_{ep}, $$ 

where,

* $T$ is the female cohort birth period that assume 3 cohort intervals: T = {1925-39, 1940-54, 1955-69};

* $ep$ is the educational pairing profile, which assumes 9 possible combinations of female and male educational levels (F,M): $ep$ = {(LP,LP), (LP,P), (LP,S+), (P,LP), (P,P), (P,S+), (S+,LP), (S+,P), (S+,S+)};

* $P^T_{ep}$ is the proportion of education paired couples for female cohort $T$ with an $ep$ profile.

The cohort fertility differences are estimated pairwise, i.e. between female cohorts born in 1925-39 and 1940-54, between 1940-54 and 1955-69 cohorts, and between 1925-39 and 1955-69 cohorts. These cohort fertility differentials can be decomposed in compositional effects of conjugal markets, which are related to changes in educational pairings distribution, and rate effects, related to changes in CFR specific for each educational pairing (see @dasgupta1993 [p. 37] for details on decomposition of rates as functions of two vector-factors). Therefore:

$$ \Delta CFR_{1,2} = \Delta CFR_{1,2}^{\text{effect}} + \Delta P_{1,2}^{\text{effect}} $$ 

We can evaluate compositional differences in terms of changing conjugal educational profiles among female cohorts and other unobserved effects that affect CFRs among each educational profile of couples.

## 3.4 Limitations of analysis

The national census data impose some limitations onto our methodological approach. Firstly, they do not provide information about the duration of past unions and their influence on reproductive levels of women. As such, we assume that women conceived all the declared children (or most of them) within the conjugal unions reported at the time of the census inquiries. An increase in the number of divorces (or re-marriages) over time in Brazil is likely to influence our estimates [@camarano2014, pp. 146]. On the other hand, the union dissolution rates in the country have been considerably stable at the low values of 0.5 and 1%, from the 1980s until the beginning of the 2000s [@ibge2014], which, in turn, causes little harm to our analyses.  

Secondly, only cohabiting couples from the same household are considered in the estimates, because the Brazilian censuses do not allow the construction of family ties from different households. Therefore, usually for economic reasons, couples may live apart, a feature commonly observed in the Brazilian Northeast [@maluf_mott1998], and we may miss some reproductive information of women whose partners were not living in the same household at the time of the census inquiries. As a matter of fact, this migration effect in lower-developed areas is higher for cohorts born in periods of intense migration flows, from the North/Northeast towards the Southeastern regions of the country, as a result of the industrialization process [@singer1973]. We tried to reduce this migration effect by grouping the geographical areas into big regions. Notwithstanding, the period of intense migration flow from the rural Northern to the urban Southern areas of the country all but ended by 1960 [@baeninger2012], affecting mostly the older cohorts born in the period of 1925-39. Nevertheless, these last cohorts are, as expected, still presenting the highest levels of fertility in the North-Northeast regions compared to the rest of the country, meaning that migration might affect the fertility education pairing estimates, but this effect is not substantial.

Finally, recent findings have brought attention to important inconsistencies of demographic measures using educational variables of Brazilian censuses. @nepomuceno_turra2020 provided evidence of misreporting of educational variables and have shown that this was an important issue especially when using the variable years of schooling. For grouped years of schooling categories such as 0-3, 4-8, 9-11 and 12+ this problem was attenuated, but implausible results for survival advantages still remained. In our analysis, we used the broader harmonized educational categories provided by IPUMS [@ipums2019]. The complete primary education (P) category, for instance, accounts for at least 6 years of schooling. Furthermore, we merged the two highest educational categories (complete secondary and complete tertiary) due to the small sample of people with tertiary schooling (especially in older cohorts), which also attenuates implausibilities found between these two groups - in terms of years of schooling - found by @nepomuceno_turra2020.

# 4. Results

## 4.1 Educational pairings cohort fertility trends in Brazil

First we turn our attention to analyze cohort fertility trends of educational pairings, following the CFRs of five-year grouped female cohorts for Brazil and its regions (Figure 1). Each panel of Figure 1 presents a fixed educational attainment level for females and each line represents the male partner's educational attainment level. The distances between lines of the same graph (panel) represent fertility differentials among male partners' educational categories, i.e. the effect of male schooling in cohort fertility.

For the country as a whole, we observe marked fertility differentials for both male and female partners. For older female born cohorts, couples with at least one partner without complete primary school presented higher fertility levels than other pairings. Male partners' low educational levels seem to have contributed to the slow down of the fertility transition in Brazil. However, increasing female education across cohorts has minimized differences in CFR between male partner's educational categories and it has induced fertility reductions [@merrick_berquo1983]. Female education increases bargaining power and autonomy of women in family decision making [@jejeebhoy1995]. Therefore, high schooled women have reproductive profiles less attached to their husband's educational characteristics and more related to females own socioeconomic status and perceived opportunity costs of reproduction [@becker1993].

The Midwest region presented a CFR transition similar to the one observed for the country as a whole. In this region, male schooling influenced more fertility of old cohorts commonly composed by women with low education. Additionally, as women achieved higher schooling levels, the effects of partner's educational differentials diminished, and CFRs got closer to replacement fertility levels. Younger cohorts exhibit similar CFR values for all educational categories of the partner and converge towards population replacement levels.

In the North and Northeast regions, cohorts started their CFRs reductions from rates above 8 children per woman among low educated groups. In these regions, we observed important differentials of male partner's fertility between the educational categories, especially for those in transition from incomplete to complete primary education. The increase of females' educational levels in North-Northeast areas induced a general fertility reduction, but this was not followed by a decrease in the effects of male partner's educational differentials on CFRs at the same pace as observed in other regions. Hence, the observed results for couples in which males have the lowest schooling level are at higher CFR levels than others. 

South and Southeast areas started their cohort fertility transition from lower CFR levels relative to other areas of the country. i.e. the rates show less than 6 children per woman for those with incomplete primary education. In contrast to lesser developed regions of the country, male education affected less changes in cohort fertility, that is observed even among cohorts of women with incomplete primary school - curves are close to each other specially for younger cohorts. These regions also present the stronger convergence process of CFRs towards replacement levels. All couples with low educated females show CFR lower than 3 children per woman. Next, we will investigate the changes in cohort fertility differentials by decomposing this measure between the effects of educational pairings on CFRs and the effects on cohort fertility of any other variable not observed.

## 4.2 Decomposition of cohort fertility rates 

Tables 1 to 4 present the percentage share of educational pairings and the estimated CFRs for female cohorts born in 1925-39, 1940-54 and 1955-69 for Brazil and its regions.

In general, we verify that educational homogamy reduced its share in all regions of the country. The reasons are linked to decreases in prevalence rates of $LP_{male}$-$LP_{female}$ educational pairings. For women born in 1925-39, approximately 81% were from the lowest schooling level and married with males from this same educational level. This number declined to 37% for females from 1955-69 birth cohorts, as an effect of compositional changes in population's education. On the other hand, educational homogamy has increased among couples with tertiary education, from less than 1% in 1925-39 cohorts to 5.60% in 1955-69 birth cohorts, a modest increment to outnumber the share percentage of couples with incomplete primary education. Therefore, educational pairings in the country dispersed among higher education categories as the educational expansion was taking place.

When we look at specific regions then different trends in educational pairing composition appears. The Midwest once more shows a similar pattern as Brazil, changing from a past high percentage of homogamous couples with low schooling to more diverse partner profiles and higher prevalence of hypogamic couples among younger cohorts.

In the North-Northeast regions we see the slowest changes in matrimonial profiles. There is a persistent high percentage of low schooled couples in union and the heterogamy share is modest in percentages. In fact, the low educated couples responded for almost 49% of educational pairings for 1955-69 female born cohorts in these regions. Additionally, hypogamic unions were already on the rise for intermediate cohorts, because the females from North-Northeast have overtaken men's educational levels earlier than in other regions [@monteiro-da-silva2019]. This lagged process of homogamy decrease and more hypogamic unions instead can be partially attributed to the historical socioeconomic inequalities of the country. For instance, these Northern areas presented a later shift to an industrial and service based economy relative to the rest of Brazil. 

The more developed Southern areas of the country observe an intense process of compositional changes in educational pairings. These areas present the lowest country's percentage of homogamous unions between less educated couples (around 31% for younger cohorts), and at the same time a later process of increase in hypogamic unions. These regions benefited the most from Brazil's educational expansion and, therefore, they showed the highest increase of heterogamous couples' prevalence rates. 

Table 4 also portraits important information on fertility differentials among educational groups and female birth cohorts. For old cohorts composed in general by low educated females, when men have complete tertiary education, the CFRs are 2.3 to 3 children per woman smaller as compared to couples formed by males without complete primary education. When we observe the CFR values for opposite arrangements (e.g. men with less than primary education in union with highly educated women), we verify fertility levels close to the ones observed for tertiary educated males. In other words, high male education does also affect couples' CFR, and in the case of higher education, this effect is almost similar between each partner.

Table 5 presents the overall CFR for these three cohorts for each region and also the results of the decomposition exercises. Brazilian couple's CFRs dropped from 6.30 to 2.94, from the oldest to the youngest female cohorts. The highest decrease was observed in North-Northeast regions, which we observe an expressive reduction in CFRs, from 8.04 to 3.79. Yet, they started their fertility transition process from higher levels and later than other areas, hence, they still presente the highest CFRs for younger cohorts (the value of 3.79 compared to 2.86 of Midwest and 2.55 of South-Southeast).

In general, for Brazil and its regions, most of the reduction of conjugal CFRs were driven by unobservable effects of rate decline (70%). The remaining 30% of CFR decline among older and younger cohorts are explained by changes in educational pairing composition. This means that a substantial part of the cohort fertility decline of the country occurred as a result of educational expansion, and due to the effects of more schooling not only for women, but also for men. This compositional effect is to great extent explained by the reduction of low educated homogamous couples.

# 5. Discussion and conclusions

Cohort fertility rates display educational pairing differentials between male and female educational categories. In particular, the couples composed by parents with low education, they present the highest cohort fertility levels, especially for older female cohorts. These CFRs' values diminished along female cohorts and between males' educational categories, even controlling for the female's educational levels. Thus, we observed significant evidence that the male partner's education effects on fertility are not negligible, and it influenced the general reduction of cohort fertility levels of the country.

In addition, these fertility differentials among educational categories of men and women diminishes among young female cohorts. We argue that this converging fertility trend is a result of multiple factors. First, the reduction of illiteracy [@figoli2006] itself plays a key role in reproductive control adoption [@martin_juarez1995; @perpetuo_wajnman1998; @perpetuo_wong2009], however, it does not necessarily result in individuals finishing primary school. Second, unexpected effects of institutional reforms of the Brazilian state, between 1970-1990 decades, fostered changes in social and cultural norms of the Brazilian society, which in turn increased female autonomy in family planning [@faria1989; @martine1996; @faria1997]. This transformations in Brazilian society were related to the development of a communications system infrastructure, which connected distant regions of the country and contributed for the diffusion of higher social strata reproductive behavior through soap operas [@faria_potter1999; @laferrara_etal2012], and to the medicalization of female population, which led to higher adoption of contraceptive methods, even by the most vulnerable social groups [@faria1997; @martine1996; @perpetuo_wajnman1998; @perpetuo_wong2009].

The regional disparities we observed follows the historical patterns of socioeconomic inequalities. North-Northeast regions showed the highest CFR levels among all educational pairings. For instance, they also presented higher and steady differentials among educational pairings, even for higher educated women. We speculate that female reproductive autonomy in these regions are lower or they present lower opportunity costs to reproductive control [@becker1993; @jejeebhoy1995], and thus, the partner's education acts as an important driver of fertility control inside the family by a higher involvement of educated males in family planning decisions [@oliveira_etal2002]. Furthermore, the converging trends of fertility levels of pairings with lower educated males is weaker in these areas. A possible explanation is that these regions were not completely integrated to the new urban-industrial economy that was established in São Paulo, due to their export-agricultural roots and ruling local elites [@singer1973; @merrick_graham1981]. In this sense, we observe lower formal labor market engagement of women in these areas [@goncalves_etal2004; @barbosa2014], which resulted in lower social constraints to reproduction [@patarra_oliveira1988]. We may say that the North and Northeast were under influence of a patriarchal family model [@aguiar2000], characterized by lower participation of women in the public sphere of society and lower autonomy in family planning decisions, consequently resulting in higher fertility levels [@becker1993; @folbre1994].

On the other hand, Southern regions exhibited the lowest CFR levels and the lowest differentials among educational pairings for all cohorts. The differences between educational pairings CFRs were even smaller for couples with higher educated females, which converged faster towards replacement fertility levels. This seems to be a result of school expansion (reduction of illiteracy) and faster transition of economy to the urban-industrial model, centered in the São Paulo area, which demanded more educated labor force and female participation in the labor market [@singer1973; @romanelli1986]. As these processes took off in São Paulo state, these areas of the country were the first ones to experience fertility decline due to new rising social norms of urban centers [@guzman_rodriguez1993;@goncalves_etal2019]. Additionally, for the lower educational level groups, the years of schooling range from 0 to 8. Since Southern areas present the lowest illiteracy rates of the country for older cohorts [@castro1998], the lower CFR levels are reflected in higher literacy rates in these regions. Finally, younger female cohorts with complete secondary school show below replacement fertility levels, independently of the partner's educational level, once more supporting the argument that education favors female reproductive autonomy [@jejeebhoy1995].

In addition, the educational pairing composition changed significantly through cohorts. Homogamy was high in the past, because of the overall lower levels of education of the population [@esteve_mcaa2007; @ribeiro_silva2009]. Additionally, as women benefited the most from educational expansion [@beltrao_alves2009], Brazil observed considerable compositional changes in population education levels [@figoli2006], and the prevalence of hypogamic couples rose significantly over the period as hypergamy showed a steady decline [@esteve_etal2016]. As a consequence, the disparities in terms of educational pairing among Northern and Southern regions kept marked. The Southern area was a forerunner of the educational expansion in the country, because it experienced first the industrialization process of Brazil [@romanelli1986;@komatsu_etal2017]. The industrial labor market was male-dominated [@teixeira2014] and it required technical skills achieved through professional education [@romanelli1986]. Hence, the highly educated male population of the Southern regions resulted in the later process of hypogamy increase.

The slow pace of decreasing low education homogamic couples, common in the North-Northeast regions, was the result of a belated educational expansion. However, these areas also displayed a faster transition towards hypogamy than others. In these regions, there was a lower market demand for schooling of the usually male workers in the primary industrial sector who, due to income inequalities, had few alternatives rather than working in the informal lower paid markets [@merrick_graham1981; @romanelli1986; @wood_carvalho1988]. On the other hand, women had easier access to schooling, since they usually performed household or professional activities that were more compatible with formal education, such as teacher formation schools [@azevedo_ferreira2006; @guedes2015].

In a decomposition exercise, we estimated that 30% of the cohort fertility decline between forerunners of fertility transition cohorts (female cohorts born in 1925-39) and medium-low fertility cohorts (female cohorts born in 1955-69) were a result of changes in educational pairing composition. For this reason, we argue that educational attainment contributes for both males and females attitudes towards family planning and fertility control. In this sense, male's educational attainment also contributes for fertility reduction, since higher education means more commitment of men to household activities [@esping-andersen2009; @mcdonald2000], and this lowers in turn constraints to female reproduction and promotes the fulfillment of fertility intentions [@folbre1994]. In regions where the education expansion of males lagged in relation to others (as example the North-Northeastern parts of the country), the fertility transition was slower and females reproductive autonomy was also weaker, due to cultural aspects and prevailing patriarchal social norms of the region in the past [@aguiar2000; @folbre1983]. In sum, we may say that the slower educational expansion for men in the less developed areas of the country might have delayed the fertility transition in the country, especially in locations where men lagged in educational attainment levels in relation to women.

It is important to mention that the lack of information of union histories lead to the main limitation of our analysis: all children reported by women are linked to current unions' partners. Also, CFRs are likely to be underestimated due to differential mortality among educational categories [@silva_etal2016]. Yet, this work brings major contributions to Brazilian fertility analysis and provides important insights on men's role in the fertility transition process. First of all, the use of a cohort approach is novel in demographic analysis of the country. In addition, we address male's educational characteristics within couples and we take into account the regional differences in terms of educational expansion and economic development. We expect this paper foments new studies on male's role in reproductive intentions and behavior of Brazilian families.

# Appendix A

Table A1 presents the sample size of each birth cohort (1925-1969) for each census year. Previous findings have shown that by overlapping cohorts from subsequent census provide reliable information of CFR by educational strata, even though the estimates for most recent census are underestimated by differential mortality between social groups [@monteiro-da-silva2019]. Therefore, we merged birth cohorts from different censuses to enhance statistical capacity and sample size.

[TABLE A1 here - sample size of each birth cohort and each census]

We did not make use of imputation for missing variables, since it was not a major issue in the evaluated censues, as can be seen in Table A2. Missing values for the educational attainment (EDATTAIN) variable represented less than 0.25 % of the sample in all census years for all regions. Missing values for marital status (MARST) were higher in 1980 census, but still represented less than 2% of the sample for that year. In regard to children ever born (CHBORN), the missing values share was higher for the North-Northeast region in the 1991 census, responding for 7.09% of the couples in the sample. For other census years, however, this value was not higher than 2%. It is important to acknowledge that for the 2000 and 2010 national censuses, all the variables presented 0% of missing variables because they were treated by the Brazilian national statistics office. Therefore, since the missing values did not account for a significant share in the composition of the five national censuses, we just excluded the observations with missing values from our analysis.

[Table A2 - missing values for Brazil and regions for variables MARST, EDATTAIN, CHBORN]

Improbable and unreliable statements on the number of children ever born were also addressed prior to the estimation of CFRs. Hence, we assumed that women can bear only one living child every 18 months, starting from age 12 [@moultrie_etal2013]. Following this rule of thumb, at the age of 15 years old, it is expected that women have no more than two children; at 20 years of age, they may have given birth to a maximum of five children, and so on. Thus, when the stated number of children ever born exceeded this threshold expected parity, for a given woman's age, we set its value to the maximum expected number of offspring, according to the expected mother's age, following this rule of thumb. After the application of this approach, a small share of women had their parity counts modified (Table A3). In this sense, these improbable parities does not seem to impact negatively our estimates, since they only account for 0.52% of the couples at the most, in North-Northeast for women inquired in the 1970 census.
