# Introduction

Brazil observed a significant drop on its total fertility levels from 1960 [@merrick_berquo1983] and since 2010-2015 exhibits below replacement fertility levels [@berquo_cavenaghi2014;@castanheira_kohler2015;@lima_etal2018;@rios-neto_etal2018]. The Brazilian fertility transition was heterogeneous within country regions and social strata in terms of transition pace and starting period [@potter_etal2010]. 

Social groups of higher socioeconomic status, especially those from urban and industrialized areas, already practiced birth control before the beginning of the generalized decline of fertility in the 1960s [@merrick_berquo1983;@guzman_rodriguez1993]. This contraceptive behaviour rapidly spread towards the lower status socioeconomic groups [@carvalho_wong1992;@perpetuo_wanjman1998;@berquo_cavenaghi2014]. Lower income and lower educated social groups from North and Northeast regions, for example, got into the process of fertility transition by 1980s and at an accelerated pace whereas Southern regions were already experiencing a declining fertility trend by the begining of 1960 decade [@potter_etal2002;@potter_etal2010].

Several factors explain the converging fertility regimes of social groups and thus the fertility transition in Brazil. Industrialization and urbanization, changes in labor market and productive structures, reduction of infant mortality rates, higher access to formal schooling followed by a higher rates of female participation in the labor market, changes in gender relations, expansion of consumer society and communication systems among other factors related to socioeconomic and technological development [@merrick_berquo1983; @paiva1987;@faria1989;@oliveira1989;@lam_etal1992;@alves1994;@martine1996;@potter_etal2002;@castanheira_kohler2017;@rios-neto_etal2018]. The different paces and periods of each region's fertility transition were a result of an uneven spread of these factors through the country which incur in non-neglegible demographic inequalities [@wood_carvalho1988;@patarra_oliveira1988;@carvalho_brito2005;@wong_carvalho2006].  

Expansion of population's access to education was one of the main drivers of the fertility transition in Brazil [@merrick_berquo1983;@lam_etal1992;@carvalho_wong1992]. Education exerts multiple direct and indirect influences on demographic processes [@lutz2010]. Family formation and reproductive behavior are affected by education through consequences of schooling on human capital formation, such as: changes in life course decisions like the increase in female labor market participation and postponement of entry into motherhood [@neels_etal2017], changes on educational composition of conjugal markets and assortative mating profiles [@mare1991;@esteve_mcaa2007;@ribeiro_silva2009] and changes in social and gender norms which foster new ideals of family size [@jejeebhoy1995;@mcdonald2000;@esping-andersen2009;@adsera2018]. 

By the time of fertility transition begining, the Brazilian educational system expansion was already ongoing fomented by a shift in economic and production model [@romanelli1986]. By 1930, Brazil went through a shift from a rural society with economic model based on the export of agricultural goods to an urban population with an increasing import substitution industry [@merrick_graham1981;@paiva1987]. Brazilian formal schooling expansion occurred, however, at a slower pace than other countries in South America [@komatsu_etal2017] and the country only reached the universalization of primary education by 1990 decade [@castro1998]. Nevertheless, higher school enrollments led to significant changes in educational composition of the population [@figoli2006], notably for women. Through the XX century, they achieved higher educational gains than men [@beltrao_alves2009;@ribeiro_silva2009], which endorsed increases in female participation rates at the labor market [@scorzafave2001] and decreases of educational hipergamy (union profiles in which male partners have higher educational attainment level than their female partners) [@ribeiro_silva2009].

This slow educational progress in the country was attached to existing unequal socioeconomic structures that restricts population access to fulfillment of its basic social needs [@barros_etal2000]. Thus, educational inequalities are a relevant feature of the country's inequalities which manifest in life expectancy gradients [@silva_etal2016], in fertility level differentials [@berquo_cavenaghi2014] and in multiple age-specific fertility schedules [@lima_etal2018] among social groups with different levels of schooling.

The Western demographic scenario of the XXI century is marked by a complexity of underlying elements which require new methodological approaches and perspectives of evaluation. In fertility analysis, we may cite cohort fertility analysis and male fertility evaluation as tools that are being used for the assessment of fertility trends, in this particular moment of postponement of childbearing [@sobotka2004;@bixby_etal2009;@neels_etal2017], rising female schooling [;@esping-andersen2009;@neels_etal2017;@vanbavel_etal2018] and its consequent effects on changing gender norms, family commitment and reproductive behavior [@mcdonald2000;@esping-andersen2009;@goldscheider_etal2015;@adsera2018]. 

Cohort fertility analysis take into account the simultaneous experiences of cohorts and social groups through their life courses which may cause distortions in period fertility analysis [@ryder1965;@sobotka_lutz2010;@bongaarts_sobotka2012]. In addition, the evaluation of male fertility trends and male's influence in the couple's reproductive decision making are starting to be addressed by recent demographic agenda despite its difficulty in terms of availability of data sources [@thomson1997;@oliveira2007;@vanbavel2017;@nitsche_etal2018;@schoumaker2019] used as a resource to tackle recent demographic scenarios. Neither of these approaches have been broadly explored in Brazil, however.

Cohort analysis in Brazil are usually based on census data as an alternative to the scarcity of reliable longitudinal surveys to track life course demographic processes. 
This methodological approach permits the reconstruction of reproductive trends of cohorts that experienced the processes of intense urbanization, industrialization and schooling expansion of the country. By linking cohort analysis of women reproductive data with the information on their and their spouse's education we can account for male influences on conjugal reproductive levels over the country's fertility transition.

This paper evaluates the cohort fertility of Brazilian educational pairings through the period of the country's fertility transition. We estimate the cohort fertility of women within specific educational pairings in order to account for male's educational influence on couple's reproductive decision making. Our analysis also reports regional trends to acknowledge historical regional inequalities in socioeconomic development.

The present work promotes important discussions and bring major contributions to Brazilian demographic analysis. First of all, there are few works that evaluate cohort fertility patterns trends throughout the process of educational expansion. Additionally, this work contemplates the partner's influence on couple's reproductive decision making [@thomson1997;@vanbavel2017;@nitsche_etal2018]. This analysis shed light on hidden processes of fertility transition that acts within changes in gender norms and family structure by assessing reproductive achievements and conjugal educational profiles of several generations which experience different life course processes and thus display diverse family formation processes. 

We observed that cohort fertility rates display educational pairing differentials between male and female educational categories. In particular, couples in which both parents are lower educated showed the highest cohort fertility levels, especially for older female cohorts. This values were diminishing through female cohorts evolution and between males educational categories, controlling for female's educational level. Thus, we observed significant evidence of male partner's education effects on cohort fertility levels of the country. Regional disparities were observed, following historical patterns of socioeconomic inequalities.

Also, educational pairing composition changed significantly through the followed cohorts. In a decomposition exercise we estimated that 30% of the cohort fertility decline between forerunner of fertility transition cohorts (female cohorts born in 1925-39) and medium-low fertility cohorts (female cohorts born in 1955-69) were a result of changes in educational pairing composition. Hence, educational attainment contributes for both males and females actitudes towards family planning and fertility control. 

# Background

## Fertility decline and school expansion in Brazil

Education plays an important role in individual's human capital, life quality and decision making [@lutz2010]. Educational systems were set up as children education was perceived as a social duty and since then, schools have gained relevance in shaping individual's transition into adulthood [@aries1978].

Schooling acts as a strong determinant of reproductive behavior of women through several mechanisms [@jejeebhoy1995]. In particular, formal education affects women exposure to childbearing by influencing in labor market participation and conjugal decisions [@martin_juarez1995;@neels_etal2017]. Education also provides the accomplishment of reproductive intentions by providing access to information on modern contraceptive measures and through support to scientific knowledge [@cleland_wilson1987;@jejeebhoy1995]. 

The massification of educational systems delivers substantial indirect effects over population fertility levels. We can mention the increasing social costs of childbearing promoted by schools and cultural changes and propagation of Western middle class values through formal education instituions [@aries1978;@caldwell1980;@folbre1983;@caldwell2006]. Further, women of high schooling levels have higher probabilities of formal labor market participation, which incurs in lower opportunity costs of childbearing than their lower educated counterparts [@becker1993;@goldin_katz2002;@adsera2018].

Therefore, the population's formal instruction is a key element in the comprehension of fertility transition timing [@bongaarts2003; @chackiel_schkolnik2003] and constraints [@adsera2018]. In most settings, social elites are forerunners of reproductive control due to their higher schooling and increased access to modern contraceptive methods [@cleland_wilson1987]. The diffusion of this behavior to other social groups sparks the generalization of the fertility decline [@cleland_wilson1987;@bongaarts2003].

The fertility transition in Brazil was characterized by contrasts among social groups. Higher educated social groups already adopted reprodutve control methods by the time of the begining of the generalized decline of Brazilian fertility [@merrick_berquo1983]. Fertility rates of different social groups converged into replacement fertility levels [@berquo_cavenaghi2014] by the diffusion of modern contraceptive methods, in particular of female sterilization and contraceptive pill [@merrick_berquo1983; @perpetuo_wanjman1998; @martine1996; @perpetuo_wong2009]. However, uneven access to family planning brought negative implications to the most vulnerable social groups [@carvalho_brito2005]. These groups made use of more harmful and unreliable contraceptive methods, notably sterilization and clandestine abortion to achieve their family planning goals [@martine1996;@faria1997;@perpetuo_wanjman1998;@perpetuo_wong2009]. Nowadays, despite similar fertility levels, social groups perform different fertility timing - lower educated women enter motherhood younger than higher educated women [@lima_etal2018]. Hence, there is strong evidence that fertility postponement for these social elites is already ongoing in Brazil [@rios-neto_etal2018].

Compared to other country's educational systems in Latin America, Brazil's educational improvements have been slow [@kang2011;@lustig_etal2013;@komatsu_etal2017]. A sustained movement of educational expansion in the country only started in 1930s [@romanelli1986] with the acceleration of school enrollment [@komatsu_etal2017]. Prior to 1930, the pressure for the expansion of educational systems were restricted to minor political groups as a result of the country's rural economy characteristics, described by its cities' geographic disconnection and by an obsolete agricultural productive system [@merrick_graham1981;@romanelli1986;@wood_carvalho1988]. 

The political rupture between dominant political classes promoted a transformation in the country's economy [@merrick_graham1981]. Brazil's productive model shifted from an economy based on exports of agricultural goods to an economy partially based on urban centers and import substitution industry [@merrick_graham1981;@romanelli1986]. The capitalist industrial economic model requires a mass educational system to provide productive and consumption capacity for its success [@romanelli1986]. In this sense, the change in productive model of the country resulted in a redesign of country's educational policies. The primary education, however, had lower incentives for its expansion than secondary or tertiary education [@romanelli1986;@kang2017;@komatsu_etal2017]. The administration of primary educational systems were under states and municipalities accountability whereas the financial resources were centralized in the federal government [@kang2011]. Therefore, urbanized industrial regions (South and Southeast) had more resources to invest in education than underfunded areas (North and Northeast) and that reflects in the structural inequalities that are still exposed over the country [@merrick_graham1981;@wood_carvalho1988;@barros_mendonca1995;@komatsu_etal2017]. 

Consequently, the main transformations in the educational policy in the period from 1930 to 1960 were targeted to prepare the population for an urban-industrial economic model. This was fostered by the foundation of Ministry of Education and Health in 1931, followed by the creation of the National Institute of Pedagogy (which now is the National Institute for Educational Studies and Research "Anísio Teixeira"), the National Institute of Geography and Statistics (responsible for country's statistics and national censuses) and national services of industrial and commercial education [marcilio2014]. In 1961, the first Law of Directives and Bases of National Education, reviewed in 1971, set up the obligation of basic education and established the bases of the current educational system of the country composed by primary and secondary compulsory schooling [@marcilio2014]. From 1970 to 2000, Brazil experienced relevant increases in enrollment rates in all educational levels [@komatsu_etal2017]. In the 1990s, the country finally achieved universal primary schooling enrollment [@castro1998].

The educational composition of the Brazilian population changed over the XX century [@figoli2006]. Women were significantly affected by this educational expansion. At the beginning, females benefited of educational gains through a sex-stratified educational system in which they received instruction to operate in specific labor sectors such as health, hospitality and education [@besse1999]. Even though this process incurred in labor market status and wage inequalities between men and women, it fostered female participation in the labor market and the translation of women from private spaces (household and family) to the public spheres of the society (public spaces such as commerce and labor market) [@maluf_mott1998;@azevedo_ferreira2006]. Thus, female educational expansion resulted in the reversion of male educational advantages [@beltrao_alves2009] and promoted important transformations in gender relations and social norms of the country through XX century [@itaborai2015] with increasing participation of women in labor markets [@scorzafave2001] and larger enrollments in secondary and tertiary education [@godinho_etal2006] .

## Assortative mating trends in Brazil

The population's assortative mating patterns are associated to the heterogeneity of social characteristics of its individuals [@blau_schwartz1997]. Conjugal unions represent an opportunity of social interaction among distinguisehd social groups, but depend on the composition of conjugal markets and on the size of each group [@kalmijn1998]. In this sense, educational composition of conjugal markets are usually analyzed by demographers due to some important advantages over other socioeconomic indicators such as income. Besides its importance in shaping individual's life course, preferences and professional realizations, education attainment is usually stable over time for adults (income, on the other hand is volatile and sensitive to macroeconomic fluctuations) [@warren1966;@mare1991;@kalmijn1998;@esteve_etal2012_1]. 

Schools (such as labor markets and neighborhoods) creates social networks in which union formation takes place [@warren1966;@eckland1968]. Therefore, the culture of massification of formal education is one of the drivers of biased allocation of partners in union formation. In general, unions take place between people of similar educational levels due to closer social contact of school classes and due to shared human capital formation [@kalmijn1998]. College educated couples illustrate examples of high homogamy (unions of individuals with similar characteristics) rates, since these individuals have spent most of its youth in the educational system with similar peers [@mare1991].

Educational composition changes in Brazilian demography were not only responsible for fertility decline [@lam_etal1992], but also had major effects on assortative mating patterns of the country [@ribeiro_silva2009]. Both educational hipogamy (couples in which females are higher educated) and educational hipergamy (couples in which female is lower educated) increased from 1970 to 2010, but educational hipogamy increased at a higher pace due to female accelerated educational gains in the period [@esteve_mcaa2007;@ribeiro_silva2009]. 

The prevalence of educational homogamy (couples with partners of the same educational level), on the other hand, decreased over the period [@esteve_mcaa2007;@ribeiro_silva2009]. In Brazil, this assortative mating pattern has major prevalence of lower educated social groups and its reduction is a result of the expansion of the educational system [@ribeiro_silva2009]. On the other hand, higher educated couples also show high educational homogamy rates [@esteve_mcaa2007;@ribeiro_silva2009], and that shed light on existing social barriers to interactions between groups of different educational backgrounds [@torche2010].   

## Reproductive decision making and family conflicts

Despite its relevant role in population reproduction, male and female interactions in fertility decision making have been scarcely analysed in demography [@nitsche_etal2018]. Generally, males are left out of fertility demographic analysis [@oliveira_etal1994;@goldscheider_kaufman1996;@vanbavel2017]. It happens due to the lack of information on male's reproductive intentions and behavior [@schoumaker2019]. However, as women, males play a key role in family decision making of resource allocation and in family planning [@thomson1997]. Hence, the evaluation of male's characteristics in reproduction of couples gain importance in a period of changing gender relations, cultural norms, family relations and assortative mating patterns.

Over the last century, this Western trend of female schooling expansion followed by increased demand of labor force and reduced social costs of reproduction led to the first phase of the Gender Revolution [@goldscheider_etal2015]. This phase is marked by the increased participation of women in the public and institutional spheres [@goldin2006;@esping-andersen2009;@england2010]. The second phase of this revolution would be guided by an increase in male's participation in the private sphere, e. g., in household chores and childbearing [@esping-andersen2009]. An optimistic perspective of this second phase expects a new balance of gender relations in the future with lower constraints to female reproduction and greater commitment of male partners to childbearing and domestic activities [@myrskyla_etal2011;@goldscheider_etal2015].

Yet, neither the increments in participation on public spaces and neither the higher schooling levels led to improvements in sexual division of labor [@england2010]. In Brazil, female participation in the labor market results in a double burden, especially for the most vulnerable social classes that are unable to acquire domestic and childbearing services from the private market [@guedes2015;@itaborai2016]. Moreover, this social constraints induce different strategies for women to conciliate their activities in the labor market with social reproduction activities (household chores and childbearing): part-time jobs [@england2010;guedes2015], abandonment of labor market or jobs in the informal market [@teixeira2014] and reproductive control control [@oliveira1989]. In the higher social strata, women dedicate lower time to household chores due to the access to home care services in the market or to higher participation in the labor market and men of higher educational levels tend to be more active in domestic activities [@itaborai2016].

Individual's educational characteristics are fundamental in shaping the life course. It acts in the public sphere by influencing decisions and opportunities in the labor market and acts in the private sphere by providing information on family planning strategies or by empowering individuals to overcome traditional social and gender norms. For this reason, in a context of changing gender norms and diversifying assortative mating profiles, it is essential to consider the characteristics of both partners to evaluate the fertility profiles of societies [@nitsche_etal2018].

# Data and Methods

## Data

This paper uses data collected via IPUMS-International from Brazilian National Censuses of 1970, 1980, 1991, 2000 and 2010 conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE, from Portuguese *Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística*). We used IPUMS data because of its time and space harmonization which allows for comparison of different demographic scenarios and areas without the need for compatibilization [@esteve_sobek2003;@ipums2018].

From the information and variables available at IPUMS and Brazilian censuses it was possible to identify individual socioeconomic characteristics of members of the same household. Therefore it was necessary to identify the educational level of household members, number of children ever born to women of the household and the respective partner of each household women. This identification is done through the following variables: household serial number, marital status and relationship with the household head. Using this information we paired women and their respective partners and stored their information on children ever born and educational attainment level. We used educational attainment level available in four levels at IPUMS: 1) Less than Primary (LP), 2) Complete Primary (P), 3) Complete Secondary (S) and 4) Complete Tertiary (T) [@ipums2018]. 

Partners were chosen based on the information of marital status and household head relationship. We chose to evaluate either formal or consensual unions because cohabitation is spread through contrasting social groups in Brazil and it responds for a non-negligible share of observed fertility levels [@esteve_etal2012_2;@laplante_etal2015;@vieira2016]. Despite formal and consensual unions display different age-specific fertility profiles [@vieira_alves2016] and different fertility levels [@vieira2016], they do not exhibit significant differentials in terms of assortative mating patterns [@esteve_mcaa2007].

By taking the difference between census reference period and women age we could estimate cohort fertility rates (CFR) for Brazil and selected regions. We restricted female ages to the range from 40 to 69 years old and male ages to the range of 35 to 79. We considered that by 40 women would already have completed or would be close to complete their reproductive cycle. This women age ranges make it possible to reconstruct cohorts from 1901 to 1970. However, we restrict our analysis to cohorts from 1925-1969 because of data quality issues related to memory misstatements of number of children ever born for older women [@brass_etal1968] and due to data contiguity issues for this older cohorts educational groups [@monteiro-da-silva2019]. For men, we chose a broader age range to increase the number of observations of couples in which they are older than women and of couples in which they are younger.

Improbable and unreliable children ever born statements were also addressed prior to the estimation of CFRs. We assumed that women can bear only one living child each 18 months starting from age 12 [@moultrie_etal2013]. Thus, when the stated number of children ever born exceeded the threshold expected parity for the respective age we set its value to the maximum expected for the mother's age. 

Finally, we grouped regions into 3 groups: 1) Central-West, 2) South-Southeast and 3) North-Northeast. These groups were chosen based on shared socioeconomic characteristics and demographic characteristics of cohort fertility and assortative mating verified in previous analysis [@monteiro-da-silva2019]. Thus, this grouping facilitates managing scale issues of small sample sizes in regions of lower population density and lower population counts of some particular educational groups.

## Cohort fertility trends of educational pairings

Assuming the mentioned conditions and the educational categories, we estimated cohort fertility rates for each educational pairing profile by:

$$ CFR_{F,M}^{t} = \frac{CHBORN_{F,M}^{t}} {W_{F,M}^{t}} $$
Where,

* $CFR_{F,M}^{t}$: Cohort Fertility Rates for cohorts of women born in time t with an educational attainment level F married/in-union with a partner that reached an educational attainment level M;

* $CHBORN_{F,M}^{t}$: Children Ever Born to cohorts of women born in time t with an educational attainment level F married/in-union with a partner that reached an educational attainment level M;

* $W_{F,M}^{t}$: Total number of women from the cohort born in time t with an educational attainment level F married/in-union with a partner that reached an educational attainment level M;

We computed CFRs in two ways for different methodological evaluations. First, we computed CFRs for each educational pairing of women cohorts ranging from 1925-1969 grouped in five-year age groups and educational levels LP, P and S+ (secondary or tertiary education completed). The last two educational level groups were grouped in order to avoid small samples of people with higher educational attainment levels from older cohorts. 

CFR trends were then evaluated in terms of both male's and female's educational attainment levels in order to visualize each partners influence on each region fertility transition. We also computed relative differences in CFRs [@vanbavel_etal2018] between men with LP and S+ educational levels in relation to those with P educational level, controlling by female educational category as described above. Trends in relative differences among male educational categories will contribute to observe possible converging patterns of fertility transition between male's educational levels such as observed for women [@berquo_cavenaghi2014].

$$ RDiff^t_{F,M = LP-P} = \dfrac{CFR^t_{F,M = LP} - CFR^t_{F,M = P}}{CFR^t_{F,M = P}}$$

$$ RDiff^t_{F,M = (S+)-P} = \dfrac{CFR^t_{F,M = S+} - CFR^t_{F,M = P}}{CFR^t_{F,M = P}}$$

## Decomposition of CFRs by educational pairing

In a second moment, we computed CFR for three female cohorts corresponding to 15 year period interval. We divided this cohorts according to phases of schooling expansion for men and women and of fertility transition:

* birth cohort 1925-39: older female cohorts, forerunners of the processes of fertility decline and of intensification of female schooling [@azevedo_ferreira2006];

* birth cohort 1940-54: women that born in a period of educational system expansion and still presented lower schooling levels than men [@beltrao_alves2009]. These women, however, responded for a large share of fertility decline in decades of 1960-80 by the influence of difusion of modern contraceptive methods [@merrick_berquo1983;@carvalho_wong1992;@goldin_katz2002];

* birth cohort 1955-1969: younger female cohorts that experienced higher schooling levels than men and faced higher labor market participation rates than previous cohorts [@lam_etal1992; @scorzafave2001; @beltrao_alves2009]. 

Taking more cohorts in consideration made it possible to evaluate even the tertiary education influence and decompose the effects of educational expansion and changing conjugal profiles in fertility by comparing each cohort group. We used demographic decomposition methods [@dasgupta1993] such as performed by @yoo2014 to assess both educational pairings *composition effects* and cohort fertility *rate effects* on cohort fertility differentials ($ \Delta CFR $). 

The overall conjugal CFR for a given period T is computed by:

$$ CFR^T = \sum_i^{ep} CFR^T_{ep} P^T_{ep} $$

Further, the differences in CFR from time T1 to time T2 are given by:

$$ \Delta CFR_{12} = CFR^{T1} - CFR^{T2}  = \sum_i^{ep} CFR^{T1}_{ep} P^{T1}_{ep} - \sum_i^{ep} CFR^{T2}_{ep} P^{T2}_{ep} $$

Where,

* $T$ is the female cohort birth period which assume 3 intervals: T = {1925-39, 1940-54, 1955-69};
* $ep$ is the educational pairing profile, which assumes 16 possible combinations of female and male educational levels (F,M): ep = {(LP,LP), (LP,P), (LP,S), (LP,T), (P,LP), (P,P),
(P,S), (P,T), (S,LP), (S,P), (S,S), (S,T), (T,LP), (T,P), (T,S), (T,T)};
* $P^T_{ep}$ is the proportion of couples of female cohort T in educational pairing with an $ep$ profile.

The cohort fertility differences will be computed pairwise: between female cohorts born in 1925-39 and 1940-54, between 1940-54 and 1955-69 cohorts  and between 1925-39 and 1955-69 cohorts. These cohort fertility differentials can be decomposed in compositional effects of marriage markets, which are given by the prevalence of educational pairings, and rate effects, which are given by the educational pairing-specific CFRs (see @dasgupta1993 [p. 37] for details on decomposition of rates as functions of two vector-factors). Therefore:

$$ \Delta CFR_{1,2} = \Delta CFR_{1,2}^{\text{effect}} + \Delta P_{1,2}^{\text{effect}} $$

Then, we can evaluate compositional differences in terms of changig union educational profiles among female cohorts and differences intrinsic to falling CFRs among each educational profile of couples.

# Results

## Educational pairings cohort fertility trends in Brazil

We first turn our attention to analyse cohort fertility trends of educational pairings following CFR of five-year grouped female cohorts for Brazil and its grouped regions (figure 1). Each panel of figure 1 presents a fixed educational attainment level for females and each line represents the male partner's educational attainment level. Thus, distances between lines of the same graph (panel) represent fertility differentials among male partners educational categories.

[Figure 1 about here]

For the country as a whole, we observe marked fertility differentials for both male and female partners between different female birth cohorts. For older female cohorts, couples with at least one partner without complete primary school presented higher fertility levels than other pairings. Male partners low educational levels seems to have contributed to slow down fertility transition process. This is noted by the high CFRs estimated for older female cohorts with partners of the least educational attainment level. However, increasing female education through cohorts minimized differences of CFR between male partner's educational categories and fomented the transition process [@merrick_berquo1983]. Female education increase bargaing power and autonomy of women in family decision making [@jejeebhoy1995]. Therefore, women of higher schooling have reproductive profiles less attached to their husband's educational characteristics and more related to females own socioeconomic status and perceived opportunity costs of reproduction [@becker1993].

This fertility differentials among educational categories of men and women diminishes for younger female cohorts. This converging fertility trend is a result of multiple factors. First, the reduction of illiteracy [@figoli2006] itself plays a key role in reproductive control adoption [@martin_juarez1995;@perpetuo_wanjman1998;@perpetuo_wong2009], however, it does not necessarily result in individual completion of primary school. Further, unexpected effects of institutional reforms of the Brazilian state between 1970-1990 decades fostered changes in social and cultural norms of the Brazilian society which increased female autonomy in family planning [@faria1989;@martine1996;@faria1997]. This transformations in Brazilian society were related to the development of a communications system infrastructure, which connected distant regions of the country and contributed for the difusion of higher social strata reproductive behavior through soap operas [@faria_potter1999;@laferrara_etal2012], and to the medicalization of female population, which led to higher adoption of contraceptive methods even by the most vulnerable social groups [@martine1996;@faria1997;@perpetuo_wanjman1998;@perpetuo_wong2009].

Central-West region presented a conjugal CFR transition similar to the one observed for the country as a whole. In this region, male scholing showed a stronger influence for women of lower schooling level of older cohorts. Additionally, as women of the region achieved higher schooling levels, the partner's educational differentials diminished and CFRs get closer to replacement fertility levels. Younger cohorts exhibit similar CFR values for all educational categories of the partner and converging towards replacement levels. 

North and Northeast regions started their conjugal CFRs transitions from values above 8 children per women for lower educated groups. In these regions, male partner's fertility differentials were abserved between all educational categories, especially for the transitions from uncompleted to completed primary school categories. The increase of females educational levels in North-Northeast is followed by a reduction of fertility levels but not by a reduction of male partner's educational differentials. 

We especulate that female reproductive autonomy in these regions are lower or they present lower opportunity costs to reproductive control [@becker1993;@jejeebhoy1995], and thus, the partner's education acts as an important driver of fertility levels through a higher involvement of educated males in family planning decisions [@oliveira_etal2002]. Furthermore, the converging trends of fertility levels of pairings with lower educated males is weaker in these areas. A possible explanation is that these regions were not completely integrated to the new urban-industrial economy that was established in São Paulo due to theirs export-agricultural roots and ruling local elites [@singer1973;@merrick_graham1981]. In this sense, we observe lower formal labor market engagement of women in these areas [@goncalves_etal2004;@barbosa2014] which result in lower social constraints to reproduction [@patarra_oliveira1988]. We may say North and Northeast were under influence of a patriarchal family model [@aguiar2000] with lower participation of women in the public sphere of society which incurred in lower autonomy in family planning and hence in a higher fertility level [@becker1993;@folbre1994].

South and Southeast areas started their conjugal cohort fertility transition from lower CFR levels than other areas of the country - less than 6 children per women for least educated groups. Male partner differentials are lower than those observed in other areas even for women with incomplete primary school. We especulate that this is a result of school expansion (reduction of illiteracy) and transition of economic model to the urban-industrial model, centered in São Paulo area, what demanded more educated labor force and female participation in the labor market [@singer1973;@romanelli1986]. As this processes took off in São Paulo state, these areas of the country were the first ones to experience fertility decline due to new rising social norms of urban centers [@guzman_rodriguez1993]. Moreover, these regions were also influenced by European and Japanese migration streams from 1850 until 1940s [@singer1973], areas where fertility control was already practiced [@coale1986]. Finally, younger female cohorts with complete secondary school show below replacement fertility levels independently of the partner's educational level, once more supporting the argument that education favors female reproductive autonomy [@jejeebhoy1995].

Next, we will investigate the differences observe between cohort observed differentials. By considering larger intervals of birth cohort groups, we may evaluate compositional effects of educational pairings on fertility transition.

<!-- This convergence process is observed in figure 2, which presents the relative differences between the extreme educational categories (LP and S+) from the intermediate educational category (P). Relative differences between male educational categories are stable through female cohorts and educational categories, with the exception for the differences observed between males with complete and incomlpete primary schooling married with women with incomplete primary school. -->

## Decomposition of cohort fertility rates 

Tables 1 to 4 present the composition of educational pairings and estimated CFR of each pairing for female birth cohorts born in 1925-39, 1940-54 and 1955-69 for Brazil and regions. 

[Table 1 about here]

We verify that educational homogamy fell in all regions due to decreases in prevalence rates of LP-LP educational pairings. Even though educational homogamy within higher educational categories has increased, it was not sufficient to outnumber the decrease in LP-LP educational pairing prevalence. Hence, homogamy was high in the past because of overall lower levels of education of the population [@esteve_mcaa2007;@ribeiro_silva2009]. Additionally, as women benefited the most from educational expansion [@beltrao_alves2009], Brazil observed considerable compositional changes in population educaitonal levels [@figoli2006] and the prevalence of hipogamic couples rose significantly over the period as hipergamy showed a steady decline [@esteve_etal2016].

Nevertheless, regions exhibit different trends in educational pairing composition. Central-West region performs similar trends to Brazil, transiting from high lower schooling homogamy to a dispersed profile with higher prevalence of hipogamic couples.

North-Northeast regions had a slower transition from high low education homogamy rates to higher heterogamy rates. Actually, the lower educated groups still responded for almost 50% of educational pairings for 1955-69 female cohorts. Also, hipogamic couples were already on the rise for intermediate cohorts as females from North-Northeast had overtaken educational levels of men before than other regions [@monteiro-da-silva2019]. This lagged process of homogamy decrease and the observation of hipogamic couples for older cohorts are the result of regional inequalities of the country. These Northern areas presented a later shift to industrial and service based economy and  higher inequality levels. Thus, there was a lower market demand for schooling of the usually male workers of the primary sector whom, due to income inequalities, had few alternatives rather than working in the informal lower paid markets [@merrick_graham1981; @wood_carvalho1988; @romanelli1986]. Therefore, women had easier access to schooling since they usually performed household or professional activities that were more compatible with formal education, such as teacher formation schools [@azevedo_ferreira2006;@guedes2015].

The Southern areas of the country observed the most intense compositional changes in educational pairings. They presented the lowest lower education homogamy levels of the country and a later process of hipogamy increase. These regions benefited the most from educational expansion, and therefore, they observed the highest increase of heterogamic couples' prevalence rates. The region was the forerunner of the educational expansion due to the industrialization process [@komatsu_etal2017]. The industrial labor market is male-dominated and requires technical skills achieved through professional education [@romanelli1986]. Hence, this higher educated male population of the Sourthern regions resulted in the later process of hipogamy increase.

Table 5 present the overall CFR for these three cohorts for each region and also the results of decomposition exercises. In general, for Brazil and its regions, most of the reduction of conjugal CFRs were driven by unobservable effects of rate decline (70%). Most of these rate effects are explanied by the works of @faria1989 and @martine1996, which we have already mentioned. The remaining 30% of the differences among older and younger cohorts are explained by changes in educational pairing composition. So, a substantial part of the cohort fertility decline of the country occurred as a result of educational expansion and schooling not only for women, but also for men. This compositional effect is concentrated in the reduction of lower education homogamy.

[Table 5 about here]

In this sense, male's educational attainment also contributes for fertility reduction, since more education means more commitment of men to household activities [@mcdonald2000;@esping-andersen2009] and this lowers contraints to female reproduction and promotes the fulfillment of fertility intentions [@folbre1994]. In regions where the education expansion of males lagged in relation to others (North-Northeast), fertility transition was slower and females reproductive autonomy was also weaker due to cultural aspects and prevailing patriarchal social norms of the region in the past [@folbre1983;@aguiar2000].
