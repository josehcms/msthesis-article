# Fertility and Educational Pairings in Brazil: an analysis through cohort fertility

The present article is a result of my MSc in Demography thesis which can be accessed through the [University of Campinas thesis repository]{http://repositorio.unicamp.br/jspui/handle/REPOSIP/333826}.

This work was supervised by [Everton Lima]{https://twitter.com/notreve81} and by [Maria Coleta]{https://www.ifch.unicamp.br/ifch/colaboradores/demografia/609/maria-coleta-ferreira-albino-de-oliveira}.

I am open to suggestions, comments and any kind of contributions.
